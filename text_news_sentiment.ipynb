    "The news are given as different news across all dates with a list of companies in a field. We will need to accumulate this up to a quarter level by company.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the very basic form we basically want the output to be a csv file in the format below. (ideally order by quarter_year then by ticker but doesn't matter). `news_sentiment` should be values between 0 to 1 where the value vaguely represents the probability of a positive sentiment. Or -1 to 1 where -1 is neg and 1 is pos. This depends on you but *make it clear with a markdown at the end.*\n",

    "Of course some averaging will be needed so to prevent data loss, you could have multiple columns representing upper quartile sentiment, mean sentiment lower quartile sentiment for example. Perhaps news closer to announcement date might affect CAR more than older news so you might take the average of the most recent 3 news before annoucement. These are just some ideas to get you started but its completely up to you. You will need to gauge how to aggregate this up. Ideally, you should have 2 output files; 1 for revenue and 1 for CAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you could also explore the use of LLMs and prompt engineering to extract specific information from the text first. For example, you could look into using LLMs to extract company specific news vs market news. Both news will affect revenue prediction but the latter should not affect CAR prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be creative!"

         "Ara Mahdessian and Vahe Kuzoyan had a simple plan after graduating from college: Write some software that could assist their dads with all the paperwork that comes with being a contractor. Two decades later, that idea has morphed into a Glendale company called ServiceTitan, which last year served some 8,000 plumbing, HVAC, janitorial and other firms with a soup-to-nuts software suite — and now plans to go public on Nasdaq under the ticker “TTAN.” The tech company, which has raised about $1.4 billion in funding since its 2007 founding, did not disclose in the Nov. 18 filing how many shares it plans to sell or how much capital it wants to raise. A spokesperson declined to comment. The initial public offering of stock marks a significant step for the company, which had filed confidential paperwork for an $18-billion offering in 2022, according to Business Insider, but didn’t move forward after the Federal Reserve sharply raised interest rates to combat inflation, freezing up the IPO market. ServiceTitan — which makes most of its money charging a subscription for its services — reported revenue of $614 million in the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, up nearly a third from a year earlier; and a loss of $195 million, 28% less than in fiscal 2023. It had about $147 million in cash and equivalents on hand as of Jan. 31, 2024, and was carrying $175 million in long-term net debt. The company, which serves contractors nationwide, says it wants to expand the number of trades and markets it serves. It employed 2,870 workers as of July 31 at its Glendale headquarters and t offices elsewhere in the U.S. and internationally. ServiceTitan has developed a web-based software that can manage all aspects of a contractor’s business, including booking appointments, generating estimates, processing invoices as well as payroll and dispatching workers. Clients range in size from family-owned contractors to large national franchises. It estimates it receives about 1% of what its clients charge their own customers, which totaled $62 billion in the 12 months that ended July 31. Competitors include BuildOps , Housecall Pro, Jobber and other companies that charge subscriptions for their web-based business management software. The founders immigrated to the United States in the 1980s as children: Mahdessian, 39, from Iran and Kuzoyan, 41, from Armenia. Mahdessian’s father started a contracting business, and Kuzoyan’s, plumbing. Mahdessian went off to Stanford and Kuzoyan got into USC, with the pair meeting at an Armenian students event. After graduation, they started in 2007 building a simple program to track customer calls and marketing budgets, but their venture soon attracted other contractors. The duo scored a seed round of funding from Mucker Capital in 2014. ServiceTitan also has gone on to make acquisitions and raise more than $1 billion from Iconiq Growth , Bessemer Venture Partners, Battery Ventures and others. Iconiq is the largest institutional shareholder of ServiceTitan, holding 24% of Class A shares. The company’s share structure will ensure that control remains with the founders — Mahdessian is chief executive and Kuzoyan president — who will retain all Class B shares, which are entitled to 10 votes each. Meritech Capital, in an analysis of the offering , said ServiceTitan appears to be eager to go public due to an unusual provision of its $365-million funding round in November 2022 when money was harder to come by. A so-called “IPO ratchet” protected participants by guaranteeing them more shares should the company’s IPO price decline below its funding-round valuation. PitchBook valued the company at $7.6 billion at the time, meaning the IPO needs to trade above a “base” of $84.57 per share or ServiceTitan will have to issue more shares, Meritech said. The base per share price also compounds after a certain time, making it more difficult for the IPO price to exceed it. “ServiceTitan is incentivized to get public ASAP,” Meritech stated in its report. Lead underwriters on the IPO are Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. The offering is expected to be watched closely for signs that the IPO market is making a comeback.",

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, will. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line rudy kessinger da davidson. please go ahead. rudy kessinger -- analyst hey guys, thanks squeezing here. believe last quarter said consumption growth slightly ahead expectations. slower year-over-year growth versus q2 last year, year-over-year growth improve q1. so, guess curious q3, could make comment regard? obviously, slower year-over-year basis q3 last year, stable year-over-year consumption growth q2 better worse? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. rudy, thanks question. specifically called relative q2. see lower year-over-year growth called out. see seasonal rebound. usually q3 stronger q2 talked smaller prior year. hopefully, help triangulate. rudy kessinger -- analyst okay. quick follow-up. believe q4 call back march. point, dev, said would least another year ai application deployed scale. sound like commentary early large workloads, thousands, many large scale. guess, expectation maybe still least another year seeing broad ai application rollouts scale? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think lot function what's happening r&d side ai, right? example, today, compelling model designed phones, right, today phone computing horsepower run complex models. so, see ton very, successful consumer apps besides, say, chatgpt claude. -- also see like hundred apps taking like saw kind first generation like internet cloud era, right, mobile era. like think still early day ai. see lot people building ai apps, lot kind fairly rudimentary functionality. think time that's going change. fact, know change. can't predict happen. see apps production, traction, seeing grow very, quickly lot platform. really meaningful. operator thank you. concludes today's q&a session. would like go ahead turn call back dev closing remarks. please go ahead. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you, everyone. wanted say really pleased q3 result strong new business performance revenue exceeding expectation -- across atlas ea. making necessary investment expand enterprise channel see largest opportunity establish mongodb standard strongest return go-to-market investments. looking ahead, encouraged progress making accelerating legacy app modernization ai well establishing standard emerging ai tech stack greenfield ai applications. last least, would like thank michael contribution past 10 year wish well. thank you, everyone, talk soon. operator [operator

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

[operator instructions] again, please stand compile q&a roster. first question come line jason celino keybanc capital markets. question, please. jason celino -- analyst hey, thanks taking questions. two me. first one, andrew. u unfamiliar janesh. tell u little bit brings autodesk? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director certainly can. that, let make sure thank betsy everything brought autodesk interim period. really appreciate it. company appreciates it. thank you, betsy. really excited janesh. let tell excited janesh. remember, one thing telling looking someone going able dispassionately drive optimization scale inside autodesk. really mean someone that's going really inwardly focused, looking every dollar invest making sure getting return business investor getting best return business. next kind criterion looking for, nice was, time seat sitting cfo, important u well. kind next nice optimization scale. janesh brings great balance things, right? seat seven year elastic, cfo coo, driving fairly turbulent change inside elastic. so, got battle star pushing inside company get change done inside, like that. like lot. also got good early experience company feel always added value autodesk. so, vmware senior position. cisco senior position. good success bringing people kind companies. worked company driving optimization scale, no. 1 criterion looking driving work. also another nice have. got knowledge industry. spent two year ptc career. actually recently ptc board. so, understands industry, able get speed pretty quickly. no. 1 goal drive optimization scale next years, make sure getting everything need every dollar invest, important theme autodesk. that, really excited, looking forward joining december. jason celino -- analyst ok. great. interesting. second question, cfo, thought might hold next investor day? think past, usually march. good time frame? soon? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. well, janesh joining december. think need give time get sea leg giving time kind drive end year actually get u set next fiscal year good stead. so, would say unlikely anything spring, get back soon janesh ready talk things. operator thank you. next question come line jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities. question, please. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank you. andrew, third quarter, three-year cagr current rpo 12%. thinking sustainability perhaps improvement upon cagr crpo next number years? think ingredient that, look like last several years, cagr unit volume brand roughly 6% 7% aggregate. so, top that, price ingredients, perhaps talk think might able improve upon recent trajectory current rpo. follow-up. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. hi, jay, betsy. let give couple things. there's number thing going on, headline crpo number. first take away headwind tailwind broadly consistent second quarter. mentioned opening commentary, early renewal growth -- new transaction model providing tailwind. there's also headwind crpo growth declining contribution billed unbilled deferred revenue risk large multiyear eba cohort coming renewal fiscal '26. reminder, larger cohort calling tailwind free cash flow next year. look back fiscal '22, saw dynamic ahead fiscal '23 renewal well. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst ok. since new management part news evening, could talk thinking chief revenue officer position. would make sense perhaps continue separate cro? think might make sense perhaps combine cro coo? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, going continue separate cro various function work together coo organization, including organization, infrastructure thing associated. looking cro someone understands continue drive business direct engagement customer. so, mean someone really understands take analyze self-service patterns, actually understand data come customer help drive cross-sell upsell also transforming channel transactionally focused extension autodesk kind solution partner that's driving life cycle solution customers. so, that's kind role looking here. yes, going continue stand-alone cro role within coo organization. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank much. operator thank you. next question come line adam borg stifel. line open. adam borg -- analyst awesome. thanks much taking questions, congrats betsy janesh. maybe new transaction model. know still early. curious, learning customer new model seeing term adoption autodesk technology ability find white space better upsell cross-sell different solution direct relationship. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, adam, really early able make kind conclusion that. tell definitely see shift direct channel autodesk customer probably served kind arm's length kind transactional level. term driving cross-sell upsell, early days, early days. want get sense might evolve, got experience ebas enterprise business agreements. learned year kind relationship customer really understand usage patterns, doing, much effective driving cross-sell upsell even partnering channel partners. so, think kind stand testament what's possible move forward completion new transaction model. adam borg -- analyst great. maybe quick follow-up. think new administration coming in, talked macro broadly consistent. change tone conversation end market term optimism ability willingness expand new project ahead administration? pause full steam ahead? curious, commentary macro perspective would really, really helpful. thanks much. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director say thing matter customer bipartisan things, right? customer care infrastructure build out. party care infrastructure build-outs. customer care domestic manufacturing europe, united states, party agree domestic manufacturing build-outs important. supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. thing bipartisan issue really affect customers. so, regardless administration, suspect thing important customer continuing focus. adam borg -- analyst thanks, again. operator thank you. next question come line joe vruwink baird. please go ahead, joe. joe vruwink -- analyst thank you. outlook next year, $2.050 billion free cash has, think, expectation past year now. within last year, also seen co-term contracts. think lead better billing fy '26. so, question is, actually create potential thing better, that's qualifying $2.050 billion midpoint possibilities. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer there's change talked free cash flow guide fiscal '26, continues $2.05 billion mid-point. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. fair enough. m&a environment, recent history, autodesk mode of, would say, strategic tuck-ins. think actually asset cfd simulation space announced au quarter. right approach autodesk, given point time, work done build cloud platform, data models, tuck-ins make sense? that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. elizabeth, betsy. so, broadly speaking, continue see growth, slower pace due number factor really last several years, macro, covid, exiting russia, elections, drag forward momentum business, really factored guidance. so, kind leave that. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. follow-up billings. understand there's lot volatility around change multiyear transaction model. look like guidance implies bigger step growth q4, despite easier year-ago compare. so, hoping could help u unpack balance headwind tailwind would drive kind greater downtick growth q4. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, again, let start fiscal '25 perspective. billing tailwind going final shift annual billings, new transaction model early renewals. going get headwind co-terming business booked ahead new transaction model launch recent weeks, fx. so, again, think continued perform well executed q3. so, think feel very, strongly expectation q4. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line bhavin shah deutsche bank. question please, bhavin. bhavin shah -- analyst great, thanks taking question, congrats quarter. andrew, university, appeared noticeable uptick attendance session geared toward owner operators. driving recent interest segment? much product enhancement guy made versus really focusing emphasizing go-to-market perspective? long segment buyer kind becomes meaningful financials? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, bhavin, that's excellent question, right. interested tackling whole entire life cycle design, make, construction, manufacturing, way operations. probably aware product called tandem. lot session driven increasing interest increasing adoption tandem, digital twin solution, tightly coupled solution also toolkit allows people easily connect sensor data digital twin solution. so, seeing uptick directly releasing product capability interest owner space. expect see trend continue time, expect see u continue talk owner space, continue deliver solution owner space even apis owner space. area great interest, especially come vertical buildings, factory thing related well as, infrastructure like water owner solutions. so, yes, owner matter. building software them, going see that. bhavin shah -- analyst super helpful there. then, betsy, one you. term underlying improvement seeing margins, know called fx transaction model. know early, think next year, think like impact fx transaction model kind headline operating margins? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, wish could give answer, think new cfo would probably little bit problem that. so, wait till end february give specific that. bhavin shah -- analyst fair enough. thanks taking may questions. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director good try. operator thank you. next question come line tyler radke citi. please go ahead, tyler. tyler radke -- analyst yeah, good afternoon. thanks taking questions. going ask placeholder next year's guidance, betsy. want waste question that, feel free answer. andrew, wanted kind ask comment made around efficiency, especially relates hiring janesh, pointed lot experience larger companies, vmware, cisco, et cetera. quarter transaction model rollout, kind visibility better channel prior channel relationships, direct billing customer. area identified efficiency potential?

         "Rohit Chopra may not have much time left as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with Donald Trump preparing to assume the presidency. But the regulator has been making the most of his likely final months on the job, telling Congress recently he didn’t think there was any reason for the agency to act like a “dead fish.” This week, the CFPB took a flurry of small actions involving the credit card industry. Among the actions: It warned companies that devaluing customers’ points might be illegal and released a study knocking retail credit cards for offering particularly high interest rates. It also debuted a new credit card comparison tool using data the agency collects that, in theory, could offer an alternative to commercial sites that it argues often rely on kickbacks or affiliate marketing. In an interview on Thursday, Chopra told Yahoo Finance that the credit card industry has a growing price-gouging problem and shared some of his thoughts on regulations that may be needed to curb it — even if it may be a while before another Democrat has a chance to implement them. Below is a transcript of the interview, which has been edited for length and clarity. Weissmann : I want to take a step back. In general, how would you describe the way the credit card industry is currently treating consumers? Is its whole business model fundamentally problematic or are there just a bunch of discrete issues that need better regulation, in your view? Chopra : I think the most noteworthy shift in recent years has been what many would consider price gouging. Very importantly, we have seen a shift in the margins on credit card interest rates. In other words, when you look at the cost of funds for big credit card issuers, and you look at other factors like consumer credit profiles, we’re seeing much fatter margins. And in some ways credit cards have been more expensive than at any time in recent history. So just to put a finer point on it: Even when you consider [the Fed’s] interest rate hikes, those credit card interest rates went well beyond that. The net result is that as consumers were walking down the aisle and wondering why things like diapers were so expensive, when they were swiping those purchases with a credit card, they were once again getting hit with high prices. Weissmann : What is your theory about why those margins have gotten so much fatter? What's allowing them to engage in “price gouging,” as you put it? Chopra : There's a whole host of reasons and we've looked at many of them. Some of them range from real in-the-weeds type practices, like how they've changed their credit reporting to obscure to their competitors who their most profitable customers are , to things that are much more in the open. And one of those things is the major role that rewards cards have now played in the market. You now see that rewards cards are not just being marketed to higher-income, prime borrowers. You're seeing it penetrate across the marketplace. Consumers are really looking at choosing a credit card based on the rewards. That’s created a market environment where the interest rate itself is less salient, and the interest rates that people are paying often wipe out way more than the value of the rewards. We've looked at this also from other angles, including how so many non-financial companies have essentially turned into credit card companies. We have department stores out there that are largely staying afloat because they're churning credit cards. Weissmann : You guys put out this credit card comparison tool. When I went online and tried it out, what struck me initially is that you can’t compare rewards very well on it, which is what most credit card shoppers — like you said — are interested in. What it does make easy is comparing the APR. I’m curious, was that intentional? Was that a way of signaling people should care more about interest rates? Or was it a limitation of the data? Chopra : So here is what I would say about the tool. As you can tell, it’s not so fancy. But what we're really trying to do is make the data public. Based on what we've done the past few years, we’re ordering companies to require data and then allowing people to visualize it with the goal that third-party comparison sites will also make use of this data. And it's going to be updated periodically. But you're right that the way consumers are looking at it now, it's mostly based on rewards, and I’m really concerned that the structure of credit cards today creates a financial incentive for credit card companies to push consumers into a treadmill of debt. Because when you’re signing up for a credit card, it’s typically a time when you feel you can pay off your balance month to month, and that means the interest rate is a lot less salient. You're then focused on the sign-up bonus for the rewards, which is very natural. And what we find is that when people start paying interest on credit cards, we are not seeing those credit card issuers fess up to consumers that they can switch to a card with a lower rate. The fundamental issue is credit card companies profit when people get into debt. Weissmann: There are obviously a lot of these comparison tools online. Why do you feel like we need another one? Chopra: We’ve done work and issued policy about rigged comparison sites. We think comparison tools are very important, but when the results are rigged, it ends up steering consumers into cards that may simply be profitable for the comparison website. And manipulated results are something that we've been increasing our scrutiny over. I’ll give one example: You have a lot of airline points websites, not operated by airlines, operated by third parties who are actually making enormous sums of money through commissions and kickbacks from credit card companies. So part of it was again trying to make the data available so that there is some unbiased data set and that there is at least someplace where people can go where it's not skewed. Are we expecting tons of eyeballs on this? No, but we have found that making the data public so that it can be used and power other sorts of tools is really important. Weissmann: You put out a report arguing that retailers are essentially responsible for a disproportionate share of the problems and bad debt in the industry. Do you think retail credit cards need more specific regulations? Chopra: One of the places that we have heard a lot from is retail workers. I've also heard this from flight attendants and others that an increasing amount of their compensation is now tied to whether or not they can push credit cards on customers. When that moves into high-pressure tactics and quotas, that can often be a recipe for what we saw at places like Wells Fargo, that even created fake accounts. So trying to make sure that there isn't too much pressure or coercion on frontline workers to push these cards, I think, could be something that we continue to do. Weissmann: Donald Trump talked about imposing a cap on credit card interest rates during his campaign. Do you think that would be an appropriate move? Chopra: I do think that there's a growing consensus about the need for interest rate caps. We've done research to show that the rates that are being charged by the largest and most dominant credit card issuers are substantially higher than credit card issuers that may not be popular name brands. We've also looked at credit unions who are subject to a federal rate cap on their credit cards and many of them have very robust businesses. So I think that's something that the incoming administration is clearly interested in and I think that's going to be a place where there's going to be more bipartisan discussion.

         "Boeing Co. BA is back in the spotlight after a Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korea’s JejuAir crashed at Muan International Airport on Sunday, tragically killing 179 of 181 passengers and raising fresh questions about the aerospace manufacturer's safety record. What Happened : The crash comes amid Boeing’s ongoing challenges, including a 30% stock decline in 2024 and production restrictions imposed by federal regulators following January’s Alaska Airlines door plug incident on a 737 MAX aircraft, reported Associated Press on Sunday. JejuAir’s shares plunged 7.67% to 7,570 ($5.14) South Korean won following the crash, while Boeing’s stock, already down 28.22% year-to-date, faces uncertain trading as markets process the incident’s implications. Aviation consultant and former Delta Air Lines chief pilot Alan Price emphasized that the 737-800 involved in Sunday’s crash differs from the troubled MAX variant, calling it “a very proven airplane” with a strong safety record. “We are in contact with Jeju Air regarding flight 2216 and stand ready to support them. We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew,” Boeing wrote on X on Sunday. pic.twitter.com/TIrIUBw4RB See Also: Veteran Investor Bets Big On S&P 500 Hitting 7,000 By End Of 2025: These Sectors Could Lead The Charge Why It Matters : The incident adds to Boeing’s recent setbacks, including a seven-week machinists strike that disrupted production of key aircraft models and January’s FAA manufacturing oversight restrictions. The company has struggled to rebuild its reputation following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people and led to $23 billion in losses. Under new leadership since CEO David Calhoun ‘s departure in August, Boeing has initiated safety improvement discussions among 70,000 employees. The cause of Sunday’s crash remains under investigation by South Korean authorities. Market analysts note that while distinct from previous 737 MAX issues, the crash could further impact investor confidence in Boeing as it competes with European rival Airbus for market share in the commercial aviation sector. Price Action : Boeing Co.’s stock is trading down 4.15% at $173.50 during Robinhood’s overnight trading service. On Friday, the stock closed at $180.72, up 0.19% for the day, before edging higher by 0.10% in after-hours trading to $180.90. Year to date, Boeing’s stock has fallen significantly, down 28.22%, according to data from Benzinga Pro . Boeing has a consensus price target of $197.85 from 23 analysts, with a high of $260 and a low of $85. The latest ratings from JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and RBC Capital average $158.33, implying a 12.47% downside. Boeing’s 30-day average trading volume stands at 10.71 million shares, with a 52-week range of $137.03 to $264.66. The company has a market capitalization of $135.34 billion, and its 14-day Relative Strength Index is at 77.4, indicating overbought conditions.

         "The U.S. housing market has been tumultuous due to persistent interest rate hikes . However, an upward revision of U.S. gross domestic product growth in the second quarter has led speculators to reconsider their bets on a substantial 50-basis-point rate cut next month. With mortgage rates expected to decrease, experts advise homebuyers to act swiftly to secure the best deals before the opportunity closes. Looking ahead, several dynamic trends are set to shape the housing market. According to a note by Norada Real Estate Investments, the market will remain strong over the next five years, though it will experience some dramatic shifts. Home prices are projected to continue rising, but at a slower pace than in recent years, offering a more gradual increase. While the supply of homes is expected to grow, addressing the previous shortage should ease the inventory crunch that has driven prices up. Also Read: A Ton Of Landlords Are About To Raise Rents This Year Despite the Federal Reserve’s past rate hikes raising borrowing costs and dampening buyer enthusiasm, a gradual rate decline could rekindle demand and revitalize the market. However, competition will remain fierce due to robust job growth, population expansion, and limited land availability. 2024 Forecast The U.S. housing market is anticipated to slow, with home prices either stabilizing or seeing a slight decline. Zillow’s latest forecast for 2024 projects a 1.8% national increase in home values, indicating a period of market stability, Norada Real Estate Investments added. Stock Opportunities As home prices are expected to remain stable or increase modestly, homebuilders are likely to benefit from sustained demand and favorable conditions. This stability should support their revenue growth through ongoing construction and sales. According to a June report by the National Association of Home Builders , the top three homebuilders by revenue, closings, and home types are: D.R. Horton, Inc . DHI : DHI stock has surged over 58% in the past year. Wells Fargo recently raised its price forecast to $220 from $210 while maintaining an Overweight rating. Investors can consider the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ITB for exposure. Lennar Corporation LEN : LEN stock has risen more than 52% in the past year. Wells Fargo increased its price forecast to $195 from $185, also maintaining an Overweight rating. The AdvisorShares Gerber Kawasaki ETF GK offers a way to invest in Lennar. Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL : TOL stock has jumped over 75% in the past year. Wedbush raised its price forecast to $148 from $120, keeping a Neutral rating. The Invesco Dorsey Wright Consumer Cyclicals Momentum ETF PEZ provides investment exposure. Overall, the U.S. housing market is poised for stability this year, with modest price increases and benefits for homebuilders. Prices are projected to rise 3-5% annually through 2029, while mortgage rates are expected to stabilize above pre-pandemic levels, Norada reported. This evolving landscape, marked by a shift towards suburban and rural demand and technological advancements, will require buyers and investors to remain informed and adaptable, the report added.

July 2024 Monthly Dividend of $0.12 Per Share of Common Stock Estimated Book Value Per Share as of June 30, 2024 of $8.58 Estimated GAAP net loss of $0.09 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, including an estimated $0.1 million of net realized and unrealized gains on RMBS and derivative instruments Estimated (2.0)% total return on equity for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 Estimated book value, net loss and total return on equity amounts are preliminary, subject to change, and subject to review by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm RMBS Portfolio Characteristics as of June 30, 2024 Next Dividend Announcement Expected August 14, 2024 Orchid Island Capital, Inc. (the \"Company\") ORC announced today that the Board of Directors of the Company declared a monthly cash dividend for the month of July 2024. The dividend of $0.12 per share will be paid August 29, 2024 to holders of record of the Company's common stock on July 31, 2024, with an ex-dividend date of July 31, 2024. The Company plans on announcing its next common stock dividend on August 14, 2024. The Company intends to make regular monthly cash distributions to its holders of common stock. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), the Company must distribute annually to its stockholders an amount at least equal to 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. The Company will be subject to income tax on taxable income that is not distributed and to an excise tax to the extent that a certain percentage of its taxable income is not distributed by specified dates. The Company has not established a minimum distribution payment level and is not assured of its ability to make distributions to stockholders in the future. As of July 10, 2024, the Company had 66,849,374 shares of common stock outstanding. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had 64,824,374 shares of common stock outstanding. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had 52,826,169 shares of common stock outstanding. Estimated June 30, 2024 Book Value Per Share The Company's estimated book value per share as of June 30, 2024 was $8.58. The Company computes book value per share by dividing total stockholders' equity by the total number of outstanding shares of common stock. At June 30, 2024, the Company's preliminary estimated total stockholders' equity was approximately $555.9 million with 64,824,374 shares of common stock outstanding. These figures and the resulting estimated book value per share are preliminary, subject to change, and subject to review by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Estimated Net Loss Per Share and Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses on RMBS and Derivative Instruments The Company estimates it generated a net loss per share of $0.09 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which includes an estimated $0.1 million of net realized and unrealized gains on RMBS and derivative instruments. These amounts compare to total dividends declared during the quarter of $0.36 per share. Net income (loss) per common share calculated under generally accepted accounting principles can, and does, differ from our REIT taxable income. The Company views REIT taxable income as a better indication of income to be paid in the form of a dividend rather than net income. Many components of REIT taxable income can only be estimated at this time and our monthly dividends declared are based on both estimates of REIT taxable income to be earned over the course of the current quarter and calendar year and a longer-term estimate of the REIT taxable income of the Company. These figures are preliminary, subject to change, and subject to review by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Estimated Total Return on Equity The Company's estimated total return on equity for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was (2.0)%. The Company calculates total return on equity as the sum of dividends declared and paid during the quarter plus changes in book value during the quarter, divided by the Company's stockholders' equity at the beginning of the quarter. The total return was $(0.18) per share, comprised of dividends per share of $0.36 and a decrease in book value per share of $0.54 from March 31, 2024. RMBS Portfolio Characteristics Details of the RMBS portfolio as of June 30, 2024 are presented below. These figures are preliminary and subject to change and, with respect to figures that will appear in the Company's financial statements and associated footnotes as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, are subject to review by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm: RMBS Valuation Characteristics RMBS Assets by Agency Investment Company Act of 1940 (Whole Pool) Test Results Repurchase Agreement Exposure by Counterparty RMBS Risk Measures About Orchid Island Capital, Inc.

The first round of bank earnings for the second half concluded on Friday, showcasing generally better-than-expected results from three of the largest U.S. banks: JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM , Citigroup Inc. C , and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC . Despite the overall positive trend, market reactions were broadly negative, particularly for Wells Fargo, reflecting some specific concerns and risks. Read Also: JP Morgan Chase Q2 Earnings: Investment Banking Revenues Up 46%, CEO Jamie Dimon’s Cautious Comment And More JPMorgan The largest U.S. bank by assets, reported earnings per share (EPS) at $6.12, surpassing the consensus estimate of $4.29. Adjusted revenue reached $50.99 billion, slightly above the forecast of $50.2 billion. Loan balances were in line with expectations at $1.32 trillion Total deposits fell short at $2.4 trillion compared to the anticipated $2.43 trillion. Managed net interest income totaled $22.86 billion, slightly higher than the expected $22.82 billion. The provision for credit losses stood at $3.05 billion, above the estimated $2.83 billion. According to Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden, trading results exceeded consensus expectations by 7%, driven by a 2% increase in Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC) and a 15% rise in Equities. The year-over-year growth in trading, at 10%, surpassed the high end of the intra-quarter guidance, which had anticipated revenue growth to be slightly above the mid-single digits year-over-year. “We expect questions on the sustainability of trading going forward in a lower vol environment, and an update on the accelerating investment banking backdrop,” Ramsden wrote. CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the bank’s cautious outlook despite the strong performance. “While market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks. These tail risks are the same ones that we have mentioned before. The geopolitical situation remains complex and potentially the most dangerous since World War II — though its outcome and effect on the global economy remain unknown,” Dimon said. Dimon also addressed the issue of inflation. “There has been some progress bringing inflation down, but there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us: large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world. Therefore, inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase fell 1.9% minutes after the New York stock market opened.

         "Electric vehicle company Rivian Automotive RIVN could provide an update on production and delivery guidance and share the impact the 2024 election outcome has on the company's future when third-quarter financial results are reported Thursday after market close. Earnings Estimates : Analysts expect Rivian to report third-quarter revenue of $1.00 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The revenue forecast is below last year's third-quarter total of $1.34 and would be the company's lowest revenue total in six quarters. Rivian has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in six straight quarters and seven of the past 10 quarters overall. Analysts expect the company to report a loss of 92 cents per share, compared to a loss of $1.19 in last year's third quarter. The company has beaten analyst estimates for earnings per share in eight straight quarters. What Analysts Are Saying: Softness in demand is a key area JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman is watching in the company's third-quarter financial report and commentary. The analyst has an Underweight rating on Rivian and recently lowered the price target from $14 to $12. Brinkman's update came after Rivian lowered its annual production guidance to a range of 47,000 to 49,000 vehicles, down from a previous guidance of 57,000 vehicles. The change came due to a shortage in a component that is disrupting production, according to the company. \"Interestingly, 2024 full-year deliveries guidance was reiterated at ~50-52K despite the production shortfall, implying unchanged demand, although we note that the softer deliveries in 3Q do not on the surface appear supply-related,\" Brinkman said. Rivian added 3,139 units to its inventory in the third quarter, marking one of the company's largest quarterly adds. The figure was higher than an average quarterly change of around 950 units, the analyst said, which could suggest soft demand. \"The softer trend to production (and possibly deliveries also) we think could endanger the company’s still growth stock multiple.\" Here are other recent analyst ratings for Rivian and their price targets: Guggenheim: Maintained a Buy rating and lowered the price target from $21 to $18 Mizuho : Maintained a Neutral rating and lowered the price target from $15 to $12 Truist : Maintained a Hold rating and lowered the price target from $16 to $12 Barclays : Maintained an Equal-Weight rating and lowered the price target from $16 to $13 Wells Fargo : Maintained an Equal-Weight rating and lowered the price target from $15 to 11 Key Items to Watch: Rivian's quarterly report will mark one of the first automotive companies to present earnings and comments after the 2024 election. Rivian stock fell Wednesday in the aftermath of Donald Trump winning the 2024 presidential election. While it's possible Rivian won't address the matte, analysts and investors would like to hear if the new presidency could hurt the overall electric vehicle company and what Rivian will be doing to address the concerns. The election win by Trump comes as Rivian faces a crossroads of increasing production capabilities ahead of the R2 launch planned for 2026 and could see lower production and delivery figures ahead of new vehicles. Another item Rivian may not address would be the competition from companies like Tesla . Rivian was mentioned as a buyout candidate to Tesla CEO Elon Musk , but he said the company wasn't interested and suggested potential struggles ahead. \"Rivian's going to have a hard time,\" Musk said. Musk previously predicted in February 2024 that Rivian had around six quarters before it went bankrupt. A joint venture with Volkswagen VWAGY worth up to $5 billion could help Rivian's financials. Investors and analysts could also get an update on this joint venture Thursday. RIVN Price Action: Rivian stock is up 5.07% to $10.20 on Thursday versus a 52-week trading range of $8.26 to $24.61. Rivian stock is down 53% year-to-date in 2024.

         "Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by 50 basis points at its September Federal Open Market Committee meeting, lowering the federal funds rate in the range of 4.75%-5% . The Fed also hinted at the potential for additional cuts in the coming months, with the updated dot plot revealing a more aggressive rate-cutting trajectory than forecasted in June . Morgan Stanley economists anticipate an additional 150 basis points of rate reductions by mid-2025, with the U.S. economy steering clear of a recession. Morgan Stanley highlights the banks expected to see the greatest net interest margin (NIM) expansion or compression through the end of 2025, based on the projection that short-term rates will decrease by 200 basis points. Midcap banks are in a stronger position as they experienced greater pressure on deposit costs (higher deposit betas) when interest rates increased. They anticipate this pressure to ease at a similar pace as rates fall. Also, midcap banks hold more fixed-rate assets that were issued when rates were much lower in 2021 and 2022, allowing for higher repricing even as rates decrease coupled with lower liquidity requirements. For midcap banks, the analyst identifies Prosperity Bancshares Inc. PB , rated Overweight, as offering the best risk-reward profile. The firm is expected to experience one of the largest net interest margin (NIM) expansions through the fourth quarter of 2025, driven by the upward repricing of fixed-rate loans and securities. Similarly, Cadence Bank CADE , newly rated Overweight, is projected to benefit from a significant rise in NIM as deposit costs decline. It has minimal exposure to floating-rate loans and net cash, which tend to weigh on earnings when interest rates drop. While M&T Bank Corp MTB , the analyst’s top pick, ranks in the middle of the group, Morgan Stanley writes that future rate cuts will slightly boost NIM—a view that contrasts with the broader market consensus, which sees rate cuts as a long-term negative for margins. Rate cuts are advantageous for the seven major large-cap banks sensitive to liabilities. These money center banks also have significant revenue exposure to capital markets, likely boosting fee income growth in a low-rate, soft-landing scenario. Morgan Stanley expects this environment to strongly support M&A and Equity Capital Markets (ECM) activity. Additionally, lower rates are generally a credit positive for the banking sector. For large-cap banks, Morgan Stanley holds an Overweight rating on Citigroup Inc C , Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS , and Bank of America Corp BAC , citing expectations for a rebound in capital markets revenues amid a lower-rate environment and a sharp increase in buybacks following the Basel Endgame reproposal. Regions Financial Corp RF and U.S. Bancorp USB are favored due to their liability sensitivity and commercial and industrial loan growth potential to accelerate post-rate cuts. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo & Co WFC is highlighted for its strong excess capital levels and the possibility of progress on lifting its asset cap, which could favorably tilt the risk-reward outlook.

         "The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both achieved record highs this week. A strong kickoff to the third-quarter earnings season fueled both indexes, offsetting concerns from last month's unexpected inflation surge. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM , Wells Fargo & Co. WFC , Bank of New York Mellon Corp. BK and BlackRock Inc. BLK all exceeded analyst earnings forecasts Friday. This triggered a stock rally and propelled the financial sector to new highs. In contrast, Tesla Inc. TSLA faced investor disappointment. The Austin, Texas-based car company is one of the worst performers within the S&P 500 this week. The much-anticipated \"We, Robot\" event on Thursday was partly to blame. The presentation failed to impress analysts and investors, alike. Critics said it was more fanfare than substance . While the company showcased its CyberCab and Optimus robot, key details about commercialization and timelines were lacking. The event sparked mixed reactions from investors, with concerns about whether Tesla can deliver on its ambitious autonomous vehicle promises. As a result, the Elon Musk -led EV manufacturer saw its share price plunge Friday . You might have missed... Economic data disappoints September inflation reports for both consumers and producers come in higher than expected, while jobless claims posted the sharpest rise in over a year. Despite the inflation uptick, interest rate expectations remained largely unchanged, with most traders and economists maintaining their outlook for a November rate cut . The unemployment spike was attributed to temporary factors, including Michigan auto layoffs and Hurricane Helene. No Stimulus Measures In China Chinese stocks saw their worst weekly performance of the year. The absence of expected stimulus measures from Chinese authorities weighed heavily on investor sentiment, despite a strong rally in recent weeks. Mortgage Rates Surge Mortgage rates saw a sharp reversal last week, jumping to 6.36% and leading to a 5.1% drop in homebuyer applications. The housing market awaits further rate cuts, but rising Treasury yields —driven by a resilient labor market — pose significant challenges to mortgage rate relief in the near term. Google fights back Alphabet Inc. ‘s GOOGL Google is challenging the Department of Justice’s efforts to break up its search dominance, labeling the proposed antitrust remedies as radical. The tech giant argues the DOJ's recommendations could dismantle its core business, impacting innovation and consumer choice.

The Company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 660,000 shares of common stock. The offering was upsized from the previously announced offering size of 4,000,000 shares of common stock, and the offering is expected to close on or about October 28, 2024 . Citigroup and Wells Fargo Securities are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. The Company has entered into forward sale agreements with Citibank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the \"forward purchasers\") with respect to 4,400,000 shares of its common stock (or an aggregate of 5,060,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). In connection with the forward sale agreements, the forward purchasers or their affiliates are expected to borrow and sell to the underwriters an aggregate of 4,400,000 shares of the common stock that will be delivered in this offering (or an aggregate of 5,060,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). Subject to its right to elect cash or net share settlement, which right is subject to certain conditions, the Company intends to deliver, upon physical settlement of such forward sale agreements on one or more dates specified by the Company occurring no later than December 31, 2025 , an aggregate of 4,400,000 shares of its common stock (or an aggregate of 5,060,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full) to the forward purchasers in exchange for cash proceeds per share equal to the applicable forward sale price, which will be the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions, and will be subject to certain adjustments as provided in the forward sale agreements.

The Company expects to use the net proceeds, if any, it receives upon the future settlement of the forward sale agreements for general corporate purposes, including to fund property acquisitions and development activity or the repayment of outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility. Selling common stock through the forward sale agreements enables the Company to set the price of such shares upon pricing the offering (subject to certain adjustments) while delaying the issuance of such shares and the receipt of the net proceeds by the Company until the expected funding requirements described above have occurred.

         "Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading: Wells Fargo — Shares of the San Francisco-based lender dropped nearly 7% after the firm reported a 9% decline in net interest income. Wells Fargo recorded $11.92 billion in net interest income, a key measure of what a bank makes on lending, below the $12.12 billion expected by analysts, according to FactSet. The bank's second-quarter earnings and revenue did exceed Wall Street expectations. JPMorgan — Shares slipped 2% despite the bank posting an earnings and revenue beat for its second quarter. JPMorgan reported revenue of $50.99 billion, higher than the $49.87 billion analysts polled by LSEG had expected. The bank's per-share adjusted earnings of $4.26 also beat the forecast consensus of $4.19 in earnings per share. However, JPMorgan had a higher provision for credit losses than estimated in the current quarter, which indicates that it expects more borrowers will default on loans going forward. Citigroup — The shares dropped more than 2% even after the bank reported better-than-expected profit as investment banking activity surged. Earnings per share came in at $1.52 for the second quarter, compared to $1.39 a share expected by analysts polled by LSEG. Revenue was about as expected for the period as fixed income revenue dipped slightly. AT & T , Snowflake — AT & T shares slipped 1% after the telecommunications company revealed that a third-party platform illegally downloaded its customer data. The data, which was accessed from Snowflake, consisted primarily of call and text records between May 2022 and October 2022, according to AT & T. Snowflake shares fell 2.5%. Bank of New York Mellon — Shares popped 4.3% after the bank reported fiscal results for its second quarter that topped expectations. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.51, beating the $1.43 LSEG consensus estimate. Revenue came in at $4.6 billion, versus the $4.52 billion expected. Carvana — Shares of the used-car platform rose 4.3% on the back of BTIG's initiation at buy. BTIG said the company has an industry-leading EBITDA margin and could be able to grow both market share and profits simultaneously. Carvana shares are up more than 80% in three months. Array Technologies — Shares jumped more than 5% after Citi upgraded the solar energy technology company to buy from neutral, citing potential for the stock to regain share after losing more than 31% year to date. Fastenal — The stock rose 4.5% after the industrial company reported earnings for the second quarter. The company posted diluted earnings of 51 cents per share on revenue of about $1.92 billion, an increase of 1.8% from the same period a year ago. According to analysts polled by FactSet, revenue came in slightly above expectations, while earnings were in line with estimates. Vita Coco — The coconut water company declined 5.5% following a downgrade by Piper Sandler to neutral from overweight.

         "Americans and Federal Reserve officials have news to celebrate: Inflation cooled significantly last month, likely giving central bankers more confidence to continue cutting interest rates. The Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, showed consumers paid 2.2% more for goods and services for the year ended in August, versus 2.5% in July. This marks another step closer toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target, as well as the lowest inflation rate seen since February 2021, when inflation clocked in at 1.9%. The annual increase was below the 2.3% rate economists projected, according to FactSet consensus estimates. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.1% in August versus the 0.2% increase in July, matching estimates. That said, “core” inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose last month to an annual pace of 2.7% from 2.6% in July. The acceleration was in line with what economists expected. However, for the month, core inflation inched up by 0.1% in August from 0.2% in July. Economists forecast a 0.2% rise in core inflation last month. President Joe Biden touted the report as a victory for the economy, with inflation coming back down to levels seen before the pandemic. “We have more work to do to lower costs and create opportunities for Americans,” Biden said in a statement Friday morning. More cuts coming? The progress seen in recent months — with inflation getting closer to 2% as well as cooling labor market conditions — pushed central bankers to cut rates by an unusually large half point earlier this month instead of the more traditional quarter-point move. Friday’s inflation report signals that another big cut that helps alleviate borrowing costs for Americans may be on its way. Still, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, who was the only one of 12 officials who voted for a smaller cut at the latest monetary policy meeting, expressed concerns that the bigger cut could “unnecessarily” stoke demand, fueling higher prices. “We have not yet achieved our inflation goal,” she said in a statement published last week. While Bowman may view Friday’s report as a welcome sign, it may not be enough to convince her to vote for a half-point cut at the Fed’s November meeting. But other officials could take it as a sign that they can continue to front-load rate cuts without having to worry as much about inflation. Meanwhile, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said in a CNBC interview last week that Producer Price Index data from August, which captures prices businesses pay at the wholesale level, pushed him to vote for the larger cut. The PPI report showed wholesale prices markedly slowed in August to a rate of 1.7% from an annual increase of 2.1% the month before. Wholesale pricing data is generally seen as a precursor to what consumers could expect to pay for goods and services in coming months. A warning sign from consumer spending, with a hint of reassurance Friday’s report comes as the mighty American consumer — largely undeterred by the highest interest rates in over 20 years — is becoming more discerning about how they spend their money. Spending last month was up an inflation-adjusted 0.1%, with spending on goods virtually unchanged from July and services spending up 0.2%. But workers are starting to see more meager wage gains: The labor market is weakening, with employers scaling back hiring new workers and the unemployment rate rising significantly over the past year. “That puts the consumer in a cautious stance,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. At the same time, the report also showed that consumers have more savings than previously thought. For the past few months, the Commerce Department has reported that consumers were saving about 3% of their disposable income. The revised data indicates they stashed away closer to 5% for those months as well as in August. However, consumers are still saving less than they had been before the pandemic, when the personal saving rate was around 7%. “The consumer looks to be on sturdier footing,” Wells Fargo economists said in a note to clients Friday. “This suggests households may have a bit more gas in the tank to support consumption.” That may not change the Fed’s calculus on rate cuts, though. Ultimately, data from upcoming job reports is likely to carry the most weight when officials make a decision at their next policy meeting, in November, on whether to cut rates and by how much, Bostjancic told CNN. One concern Fed officials may have is that steeper cuts could, as Bowman expressed, incentivize spending that consumers are currently pushing off, which is helping keep inflation in check. Bostjancic, however, feels that even if the central bank were to lower rates by another half point in November, they’d still be high enough to stop consumers from going on major spending sprees. On the other hand, lower- and middle-income consumers in particular are suffering financially such that “they need some interest rate relief,” she said.",

         "By GABRIELA SÁ PESSOA, BARBARA ORTUTAY and DAVID BILLER SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil started blocking Elon Musk’s social media platform X early Saturday, making it largely inaccessible on both the web and through mobile apps after the billionaire refused to name a legal representative to the country. The move escalates a monthslong feud between Musk and a Brazilian Supreme Court justice over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the suspension on Friday. To block X, Brazil’s telecommunications regulator, Anatel, told internet service providers to suspend users’ access to the social media platform. As of Saturday after midnight local time, major operators had begun doing so. De Moraes had warned Musk on Wednesday night that X could be blocked in Brazil if he failed to comply with his order to name a representative, and established a 24-hour deadline. The company hasn’t had a representative in the country since earlier this month. “Elon Musk showed his total disrespect for Brazilian sovereignty and, in particular, for the judiciary, setting himself up as a true supranational entity and immune to the laws of each country,” de Moraes wrote in his decision on Friday. The justice said the platform will stay suspended until it complies with his orders, and also set a daily fine of 50,000 reais ($8,900) for people or companies using VPNs to access it. In a later ruling, he backtracked on his initial decision to establish a 5-day deadline for internet service providers themselves — and not just the telecommunications regulator — to block access to X, as well as his directive for app stores to remove virtual private networks, or VPNs. Brazil is one of the biggest markets for X, which has struggled with the loss of advertisers since Musk purchased the former Twitter in 2022. Market research group Emarketer says some 40 million Brazilians, roughly one-fifth of the population, access X at least once per month. “This is a sad day for X users around the world, especially those in Brazil, who are being denied access to our platform. I wish it did not have to come to this – it breaks my heart,” X’s CEO Linda Yaccarino said Friday night, adding that Brazil is failing to uphold its constitution’s pledge to forbid censorship. X had posted on its official Global Government Affairs page late Thursday that it expected X to be shut down by de Moraes, “simply because we would not comply with his illegal orders to censor his political opponents.” “When we attempted to defend ourselves in court, Judge de Moraes threatened our Brazilian legal representative with imprisonment. Even after she resigned, he froze all of her bank accounts,” the company wrote. X has clashed with de Moraes over its reluctance to comply with orders to block users. Accounts that the platform previously has shut down on Brazilian orders include lawmakers affiliated with former President Jair Bolsonaro’s right-wing party and activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy. X’s lawyers in April sent a document to the Supreme Court in April, saying that since 2019 it had suspended or blocked 226 users. In his decision Friday, de Moraes’ cited Musk’s statements as evidence that X’s conduct “clearly intends to continue to encourage posts with extremism, hate speech and anti-democratic discourse, and to try to withdraw them from jurisdictional control.” In April, de Moraes included Musk as a target in an ongoing investigation over the dissemination of fake news and opened a separate investigation into the executive for alleged obstruction. Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist,” has repeatedly claimed the justice’s actions amount to censorship, and his argument has been echoed by Brazil’s political right. He has often insulted de Moraes on his platform, characterizing him as a dictator and tyrant. De Moraes’ defenders have said his actions aimed at X have been lawful, supported by most of the court’s full bench and have served to protect democracy at a time it is imperiled. He wrote Friday that his ruling is based on Brazilian law requiring internet services companies to have representation in the country so they can be notified when there are relevant court decisions and take requisite action — specifying the takedown of illicit content posted by users, and an anticipated churn of misinformation during October municipal elections. The looming shutdown is not unprecedented in Brazil. Lone Brazilian judges shut down Meta’s WhatsApp, the nation’s most widely used messaging app, several times in 2015 and 2016 due to the company’s refusal to comply with police requests for user data. In 2022, de Moraes threatened the messaging app Telegram with a nationwide shutdown, arguing it had repeatedly ignored Brazilian authorities’ requests to block profiles and provide information. He ordered Telegram to appoint a local representative; the company ultimately complied and stayed online. X and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in several countries — mostly authoritarian regimes such as Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan , Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest. Twitter was banned in Egypt after the Arab Spring uprisings, which some dubbed the “Twitter revolution,” but it has since been restored. A search Friday on X showed hundreds of Brazilian users inquiring about VPNs that could potentially enable them to continue using the platform by making it appear they were logging on from outside the country. It was not immediately clear how Brazilian authorities would police this practice and impose fines cited by de Moraes. “This is an unusual measure, but its main objective is to ensure that the court order to suspend the platform’s operation is, in fact, effective,” Filipe Medon, a specialist in digital law and professor at the law school of Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university in Rio de Janeiro, told The Associated Press. Mariana de Souza Alves Lima, known by her handle MariMoon, showed her 1.4 million followers on X where she intends to go, posting a screenshot of rival social network BlueSky. On Thursday evening, Starlink, Musk’s satellite internet service provider, said on X that de Moraes this week froze its finances, preventing it from doing any transactions in the country where it has more than 250,000 customers. “This order is based on an unfounded determination that Starlink should be responsible for the fines levied—unconstitutionally—against X. It was issued in secret and without affording Starlink any of the due process of law guaranteed by the Constitution of Brazil. We intend to address the matter legally,” Starlink said in its statement. The law firm representing Starlink told the AP that the company appealed, but wouldn’t make further comment. Musk replied to people sharing the reports of the freeze, adding insults directed at de Moraes. “This guy @Alexandre is an outright criminal of the worst kind, masquerading as a judge,” he wrote. Musk later posted on X that SpaceX, which runs Starlink, will provide free internet service in Brazil “until the matter is resolved” since “we cannot receive payment, but don’t want to cut anyone off.” In his decision, de Moraes said he ordered the freezing of Starlink’s assets, as X didn’t have enough money in its accounts to cover mounting fines, and reasoning that the two companies are part of the same economic group. While ordering X’s suspension followed warnings and fines and so was appropriate, taking action against Starlink seems “highly questionable,” said Luca Belli, coordinator of the Getulio Vargas Foundation’s Technology and Society Center. “Yes, of course, they have the same owner, Elon Musk, but it is discretionary to consider Starlink as part of the same economic group as Twitter (X). They have no connection, they have no integration,” Belli said. ___ Ortutay reported from San Francisco and Biller from Rio. AP writer Mauricio Savarese contributed from Sao Paulo.

         "raised around US$21 billion in an expanded share sale, one of the largest ever by a public company, shoring up its balance sheet as it seeks to stave off a potential credit rating downgrade to junk. The U.S. planemaker sold 112.5 million common shares for US$143 each, according to a statement. The stock was priced at a discount of about 7.7 per cent to the Friday closing price of US$155.01. Boeing also sold US$5 billion of depositary shares. The company’s stock was down 0.5 per cent in pre-market trading. It’s plunged about 42 per cent this year, the second worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The infusion of funds clears one of new chief executive Kelly Ortberg’s most urgent tasks amid a period of financial turmoil for the planemaker. Boeing’s balance sheet was already strained by the pandemic, and before that two fatal jet crashes involving its workhorse model. Now there’s a labour strike, in its seventh week, that’s crippling manufacturing of the jetliner. Boeing needed the capital infusion to maintain its investment-grade rating and fund its jet production ramp-up once the walkout ends. The company is on track to burn around US$4 billion in cash during the fourth quarter, which would bring its cash outflows to around US$14 billion for the year. The planemaker expects to continue burning cash through the first half of next year as it restarts its factories, including the 737 Max assembly lines. Boeing factory workers voted last week to reject the company’s latest contract offer, which included a wage increase of 35 per cent spread over four years. The company plans to cut its workforce by about 10 per cent, Ortberg said in a memo to employees Oct. 11. The company on Oct. 23 received clearance from the U.S. to sell as much as US$25 billion of equity and debt. Boeing also has a separate new credit agreement in place for US$10 billion, giving it “additional short-term access to liquidity as we navigate through a challenging environment.” Ortberg is also considering options to streamline Boeing’s broad portfolio. He has launched a review of its businesses that the CEO expects to conclude by year-end. The company is weighing options for the future of its troubled Starliner space capsule program as part of the review, Bloomberg News has reported. The underwriters have the option to sell an additional 16.9 million common shares and US$750 million in depositary shares. , , and led the capital raise, while Wells Fargo & Co., BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, and SMBC Nikko also worked on the deal, the statement shows. PJT Partners Inc. acted as Boeing’s financial adviser for the offerings.",

Srinivasan, head of agency; and Ken Adler, head of mortgage servicing rights. And with that, I'll turn the call over to David. David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. Today, I'll briefly review the macro and market environment, along with our performance during the quarter. Then I'll provide an update on each of our three businesses and end with our outlook. Serena will then discuss our financials, after which we'll open the call up to Q&A. Now starting with the macro landscape. Financial markets benefited from both the Federal Reserve beginning the long-anticipated cutting cycle, as well as the continued robust pace of growth exhibited by the U.S. economy. With respect to the Fed, as all are aware, policy rates were lowered by 50 basis points in September in turn, ending 16 months of 5% plus short-term interest rates and policymakers signaled that they will continue to ease over time as current rates remain restrictive. With the pace and extent of easing dependent on economic data. Now the change in monetary policy was driven both by the labor market moving into better balance as hiring slowed over the summer, as well as the continued normalization of inflation, with core PCE likely to run only slightly above 2% annualized for the third quarter. The market's pricing of additional rate cuts has led to a steeper yield curve, increasing the attractiveness of fixed-income assets. In agency MBS in particular. In addition, interest rate volatility declined over the quarter to the lowest level seen since the onset of the March '23 regional banking crisis, though it remains meaningfully above pre-COVID average levels. Meanwhile, economic growth has been resilient with estimates for Q3 GDP roughly in line with the 3% annualized expansion in the second quarter. Now these developments have been supportive of our diversified housing model as seen in the performance we delivered on the quarter. We generated an economic return of 4.9% for Q3 and 10.5% year to date and our earnings available for distribution again exceeded our dividend. Economic leverage ticked down slightly to 5.7 turns, which we anticipate maintaining over the near term. And also to note, our performance and the constructive backdrop for Annaly's investment strategies allowed us to raise $1.2 billion of accretive common equity since the beginning of the third quarter through our ATM program. The environment to deploy capital remains attractive, and the market value of all three of our business lines increased quarter over quarter. Notably, roughly 40% of the proceeds raised were from negotiated sales following investor reverse inquiries, underscoring the value proposition, and associated institutional demand. Now turning to our portfolios and beginning with agency MBS. In light of the capital raise, our agency portfolio grew by just over $4 billion notional with the remaining increase in market value attributable to price appreciation. As mortgage rates declined over the quarter, prepayment concerns weighed on generic higher coupons, while lower coupons and specified pools with prepayment protection outperformed. Now this was less of a concern for us as the focus of our methodical migration up in coupon over the past two years has been on high-quality specified pools. For example, our 6s and higher represent roughly a quarter of our portfolio. And within these coupons, only a small fraction of our pools are backed by generic collateral and approximately 70% have what we would characterize as high-quality prepayment protection and the benefits of our collateral selection were best seen in the latest prepayment report. Now as the third quarter unfolded and higher coupons lagged into the rally, particularly in September. We did rotate an additional 5% of the portfolio from intermediate coupons to higher coupon collateral on a relative value basis. Now as it relates to our hedge portfolio, we maintained conservative interest rate exposure throughout the quarter, while benefiting from a steepening bias. As rates rallied, we proactively managed our rate exposure as mortgage durations contracted but ended the quarter with minimal duration thus helping prepare us for the recent sell-off as the fourth quarter has unfolded. Now shifting to residential credit. The portfolio ended Q3 at $6.5 billion in economic market value with $2.3 billion of dedicated capital representing 18% of the firm's equity. The market value of the portfolio increased by $535 million quarter over quarter, driven by the continued growth of our correspondent platform with our whole loan and retained OBX securitization portfolio increasing by $640 million. Residential credit spreads were range-bound during the quarter with new issue AAA non-QM securities trading in the 10-basis-point range providing a supportive backdrop for our OBX securitization platform. Now capitalizing on the firmness in credit spreads, we priced six securitizations totaling $3.3 billion in UPB since the beginning of the third quarter and have now priced 18 securitizations totaling $9.4 billion in 2024, maintaining Onslow Bay, the largest nonbank sponsor in the residential credit market and second largest overall. Year to date, these transactions have led to the organic creation of over $1.3 billion in market value of retained OBX securities across Annaly and our joint venture with projected ROEs on deployed capital of 12% to 15%. Our correspondent channel produced record volumes again in Q3 across both locks and fundings at $4.4 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. And we have now achieved 11 consecutive months of expanded credit lock volume in excess of $1 billion per month. And the momentum of the channel continued into Q4 as we have a current lock pipeline of $2.2 billion with strong credit characteristics and limited layer risk representing a 754 weighted average FICO and a 68 LTV. Our disciplined focus on underwriting sound credit risk and our proactive asset management has led to Onslow Bay's non-QM securitizations having the lowest delinquencies across the top 10 issuers in the market. And while the overall serious delinquency rate on the entire GAAP portfolio remains nominal at under 1.4%. And our resi business is very well-positioned given the optionality of our ever-growing correspondent channel and our ability to manufacture high-yielding assets across all spread environments. Now moving to the MSR business. Our portfolio ended the third quarter at $2.8 billion in market value, utilizing $2.5 billion in equity representing 21% of the firm's capital. Our MSR holdings, including unsettled acquisitions, were up modestly as we committed to purchase one bulk transaction comprising $125 million in market value, which we expect to close before year-end. And notwithstanding the 80-basis-point decline in mortgage rates on the quarter, the valuation on our MSR portfolio decreased minimally to a 5.6 multiple, highlighting the durability of a portfolio that is 300 basis points out of the money. Fundamental performance of the portfolio continues to be strong with a three-month CPR of 3.9% and serious delinquencies are mere 45 basis points. Deposit income remains elevated given the shape of the curve and increased competition in the subservicing market should benefit financial participants like Annaly. And on the strategic front related to MSR, Annaly's long history of formulating value-add partnerships was again on display this quarter. As we announced a subservicing partnership with Rocket Mortgage in early October. Annaly's size and the stability of our capital helped develop this relationship, and we're pleased to be Rocket's first agency MSR sub-servicing partner. Rocket is expected to begin servicing loans for us as early as December, and this collaboration should allow Annaly to benefit from Rocket's best-in-class recapture capabilities and we expect it to increase our competitiveness in purchasing new MSR. And similar to our existing subservicing agreements, our Rocket agreement allows Annaly to participate in the gain on sale of the loan refinanced helping to preserve and protect our portfolio. This new partnership in conjunction with our existing recapture agreements should allow Annaly to leverage best-in-class industry partners without taking on the operational leverage and earnings cyclicality of an originator. Now lastly, as it relates to our outlook, we remain optimistic that our business model is well-positioned with the Fed's cutting cycle now officially underway and the potential realization of a soft landing. We do, however, remain disciplined in our management of the portfolio concerning leverage, liquidity, and duration exposure given the Fed's meeting-to-meeting dependence in the upcoming presidential election. We remain in a very attractive environment for agency MBS given elevated investor inflows, a steeper yield curve, and an improving technical backdrop. Our Onslow Bay home loan correspondent channel has continued to bring in record volume and allows us to create proprietary assets not available to the broader market. Our ability to create industry-leading partnerships within MSR and our low gross WACC portfolio have created differentiated advantages. And collectively, we have all the pieces in place across our residential housing finance businesses to deliver stable returns as demonstrated by our 25% economic return realized over the past two years. And now with that, I'll hand it over to Serena to discuss the financials. Serena Wolfe -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, David. Today, I will provide brief financial highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Consistent with prior quarters, while our earnings release disclosures GAAP and non-GAAP earnings metrics, my comments will focus on our non-GAAP EAD and related key performance metrics, which exclude PAA. As of September 30, 2024, our book value per share increased from $19.25 in the prior quarter to $19.54. Strong performance across all our businesses contributed to the realization of a 4.9% economic return, including our dividend of $0.65 for Q3. When added to our first-half performance, we have generated an economic return of 10.5% year to date for 2024. Lower interest rate volatility during the quarter, combined with modestly lower treasury rates, resulted in gains on our agency MBS portfolio of $4.30 per share. Our resi portfolio continued to add to book value, contributing $0.24 per share and lower rates adversely impacted MSR values for the quarter by $0.06. Together with the agency returns, these portfolio gains outpaced the losses on our hedging portfolio of $4.23 per share. Earnings available for distribution per share exceeded our dividend though decreased modestly in the third quarter compared to Q2 2024, mainly due to an increase in share count and slightly higher preferred dividend expense. Due to our Series 1 preferred changing from fixed to floating as of June 30, 2024. That said, earnings available for distribution on an absolute basis increased on higher coupon income related to continued rotation up in coupon on the agency portfolio and additional yield provided by the securitization of the assets sourced through the Onslow Bay correspondent channel. Consequently, average asset yields ex-PAA increased 11 basis points to 5.25% in Q3. Increased coupon income was partly offset by a marginal increase of 3 basis points in our economic cost of funds for the quarter. Average repo rates declined 3 basis points during the quarter but were offset by higher securitized debt expense from the six securitizations that closed during the quarter. Our swap interest component benefited EAD as we actively managed the hedge book throughout the quarter during the rates market rally. Based on the earlier factors, our net interest spread ex-PAA, improved by 8 basis points to 1.32%. Our net interest margin ex-PAA declined by 6 basis points to 1.52%, primarily due to nuances in the calculation of NIM that are not apparent in NIM. For example, the impact of the higher denominator of average interest-earning assets in TBA notional and not an indicator of a decline in income from interest-earning assets. Turning to details on financing. We continue to see strong demand for funding for our agency and nonagency security portfolios. Our repo strategy is considered with prior quarters with the book position around Fed meeting dates we look to take advantage of any future rate cuts. As a result, our Q3 reported weighted average repo days were 34 days, down two days compared to Q2. Today, we have maintained our disciplined approach to diversifying our funding options in our credit businesses. We added $560 million of warehouse capacity for residential credit, which brings our total warehouse capacity across both credit businesses to $4.7 billion with a utilization rate of 40% as of September 30. Post quarter end, we implemented an additional MSR warehouse facility for $300 million, adding to our substantial availability. Annaly's unencumbered assets increased to $6.5 billion in the third quarter, compared to $5.4 billion in the second quarter, including cash and unencumbered agency MBS of $4.7 billion. In addition, we have approximately $900 million in fair value of MSR that has been placed to committed warehouse facilities, that remain undrawn and can be quickly converted to cash, subject to market advanced rates. We have approximately $7.4 billion of assets available for financing, up $1.1 billion compared to last quarter. Finally, turning to expenses. Our efficiency ratios improved during the quarter due to lower other G&A costs and higher average equity balances. This resulted in our opex to equity ratio decreasing 10 basis points to 1.48% for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our opex-to-equity ratio remains in line with historical amounts at 1.46%. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for questions. Thank you, operator. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] And the first question will be from Richard Shane from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane -- Analyst Thanks, everybody, for taking my question this morning. Look, the history of mortgage REITs suggests that the known risks are pretty manageable. It's the unexpected risks. It's when you think rates are going up and they go down. It's when you think rates are going down, that they go up that you get, you experienced the greatest turmoil. Fourth quarter has started with base rates going up, spreads widening, higher volatility. Can you tell us a little bit about how you're managing that and particularly in light of political uncertainty over the next two-and-a-half weeks? David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Hi, Rick, and thank you. That's actually a good question to kick off the call here. So we came into the quarter with virtually no rate risk, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. And if you look at our rate shots, that reinforces that notion. And our leverage was down a touch heading into the quarter. Now at the onset of the quarter, we got payrolls, which was certainly stronger than expected, and we proactively managed the portfolio selling roughly $2 billion in agency MBS, given the pickup in ball and higher rates. And we've actively managed the rate risk as the market has sold off. We probably sold a little over $3 billion 10-year equivalents over the course of the month of October. But nevertheless, the portfolio has extended. We're operating at today, approximately half a year in duration, which we're perfectly comfortable with here, notwithstanding the election uncertainty. When we take a step back and look at the rates market, here, we're sitting here today with 10-year real yields approaching 2% nominal yields on the 10-year 420, which is 135 basis points or thereabouts above the rest of the G7, which looks reasonable. OIS at 370 as a proxy for future short rates looks perfectly reasonable to us. And the five-year note of 4% or just above 4% here, it looks fair. Now in the 340s, as we sat in mid-September, it looked certainly rich, and that's why we didn't carry any rate risk. Market is pricing, a terminal funds rate 50 basis points higher than where the Fed is at, which is a big reversal from where we were at before, and that's encouraging. We're respectful of the data, which has been quite strong. And so we understand the volatility that's materialized. And obviously, as you point out, the election is front and center. And it warrants maintaining a very conservative position. Given that we sold mortgages, our leverage position has maintained -- we've maintained the leverage position. We feel good about it. And as we go through the next couple of weeks, we're going to be very disciplined about managing our rate and basis risk here because this is a big unknown. If we do get a red wave, then the points I made about market pricing, may look a little too optimistic, and we'll see where that -- how that plays out. But for now, we're keeping things close to home. We like our basis exposure and we're going to manage our rate risk here. Does that help? Rick Shane -- Analyst That's very helpful. Thank you, guys, and thank you for squeezing me in this morning. I appreciate it. David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer You bet, Rick. Have a good morning. Operator The next question will be from Bose George from KBW. Please go ahead. Bose George -- Analyst Hey, everyone. Good morning. Can I start just with asking for an update on book value? David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Sure, Bose. Good morning. Through Friday, we were off just a little over 1% in book value. That's pre-dividend accrual. If you consider the dividend accrual, it's roughly 0.5% off. Bose George -- Analyst OK, great. And then, I mean, in terms of dividend, I guess you've commented that you're comfortable through '24. Any -- are you ready to sort of discuss the outlook into '25, how you feel about the dividend? David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Well, as we sit here today, we feel good about the dividend. We're in a safe place here. We do expect to modestly earn a little bit more this quarter, the fourth quarter than in Q3. We expect our NIM to increase modestly. But look, we have to see how things play out. We need to understand the Fed's direction, the market's direction before we can really understand where the dividend is going. Obviously, there's been dividend increases over the course of the last number of months in the sector, but a lot of that was coming from very low levels to get to not-so-low levels and some others that were essentially approaching or contextual with our dividend currently. But 13.5% roughly a dividend yield on book, I think, 13.3%. It's a solid return and we're much more focused on economic return and making sure that we can deliver the dividend. And as the market and policy plays out heading into 2025, we do certainly recognize that the Fed's posture provides a tailwind to a lot of aspects of our business and certainly EAD, and we're hopeful that we do get the cuts that are priced in, and we'll see how it goes. Bose George -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Thank you, Bose. Operator And the next question is from Doug Harter from UBS. Please go ahead. Douglas Harter -- Analyst Thanks. Can you talk about how you're thinking about equity allocation, capital allocation to the three businesses and kind of how different rate scenarios might change your appetite for that capital allocation? David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Sure. And look, as I noted in my prepared remarks, all three of our businesses weren't growing. We can generate good returns across the three businesses. But right here, given where we're at in the cycle at the beginning of sequence of rate cuts, agency does look the best. Now we understand volatility is high, but spreads are considerate of that and the technicals in the agency market have become much more supportive. So at the margin, agency looks a little bit better. And you can see that in our capital allocation at quarter end as we raise capital, the vast majority did go into the agency sector. Now we do want to get the resi credit business higher, certainly. We'll have to see how originations materialize. But when you look at the returns in that business, through securitization from loans acquired through our correspondent channel, we want to keep growing that, and we expect to do so, but we got to be responsible at credit or with respect to credit here at this point in the cycle. So we feel like we can keep that engine going. And then in MSR, that does tend to be episodic. We, again, would like to grow it, and we'll see the extent to which packages do come to market, and we'll be certainly aggressive as that materializes. But at the margin, agency is where the marginal dollar is going, and we'll keep it balanced overall, though. Douglas Harter -- Analyst I guess just on your comment that all three businesses kind of warrant an investment, with that comment, how do you think about continued capital raising in this environment? David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Sure. Look, as we've always said, we'll only raise capital if it's accretive and if assets are priced appropriately. So to the extent that that -- those stars line up, we'll consider it. But we are -- we have ample liquidity. If you look at where our liquid box is, as Serena mentioned, $4.7 billion in agency MBS cash. We don't need to raise capital. A lot of the justification in our minds for the capital raise was obviously accretive in assets, but also the ability to generate more scale for these businesses without impacting our operating expense ratio. And we feel like we have greater resources now to be able to make investments in things like technology, as well as broadening the correspondent channel and the resi efforts and other things, to where we feel good about capital raising because I'd characterize it as offensive scale. We're clearly fully skilled across our businesses, and we are among -- we are the most efficient for anybody who has this broad of a business mix in the market running these three businesses is about 150 basis points of opex to equity. But it does help to raise equity so that we can make the appropriate investments to generate more initiatives that will ultimately benefit the shareholder over the long term. So that's just a little thought -- a little of our thought process around raising capital. We don't need to. But if the market is telling us to do so, we'll consider it. Douglas Harter -- Analyst Great. Thank you, David. David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Thank you, Doug. Operator And the next question is from Jason Weaver from JonesTrading. Please go ahead. Jason Weaver -- Analyst Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. David -- and maybe Mike can provide some input, too. I was wondering if you're seeing anything in the securitization data out there just given your visibility that might indicate any kind of early stress like first-time delinquencies, slow pays, grace period maximization? Mike Fania -- Deputy Chief Investment Officer and Head of Residential Credit Yes. Jason, this is Mike. Thanks for the question. I think in terms of the -- a lot of the commentary around the consumer, it's more focused on the lower-end consumer, the low to medium-income borrower. That's not consistent with the type of borrower that we're lending to. So if you look at non-QM 15, the latest transaction that we priced that average loan size is $495,000 on 68 LTV, that's $730,000 property value. Our average borrower makes about $250,000 per year. So when you think about the type of borrowers we're lending to, it's very sophisticated self-employed borrowers, it's professional real estate investors. We are not necessarily seeing that stress that other products are seeing like credit cards, like that lower-end consumer like subprime auto. You're not seeing within the portfolio. David mentioned it earlier in the call, but the D60+ of our entire portfolio, it's 137 basis points. And when we look at just the non-QM, the DSCR part of the portfolio, it's around 2%. So I think we feel very good with the type of credit that we're originating and the borrowers, specifically that we're targeting. Jason Weaver -- Analyst That's helpful. And I'm wondering more in a macro sense, just seeing if there's any persistence into that higher level credit quality. But it sounds like not. And then going back to your remarks on the Rocket partnership, I think you had mentioned seeing some greater competition among subservicers. Should we take that to expect any better pricing on subservicing expense or any change in the economics that are more favorable to Annaly when that product comes online partnership? David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Yes, sure. Jason, we'll have Ken on that one. Ken Adler -- Head of Mortgage Servicing Rights Jason, thanks for the question. In short, absolutely, as MSR, as there's been substantial MSR trading in the last few years, the amount leaving sub-servicers and going to owners who service their own loans has been material. So there's been a contraction in the share of overall mortgage servicing rights handled by sub-servicers and that's created a lot of competition in the market. So we are seeing lower pricing and better economic. Jason Weaver -- Analyst All right. That's helpful. Thank you for the color. David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Thank you, Jason. Operator And the next question is from Eric Hagen from BTIG. Please go ahead. Eric Hagen -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning. So when we look historically at the portfolio, the book value has been consumed by a higher bond premium. I think at one point, the premium in the agency portfolio was like a third of book value versus now the premium risk is a lot more dialed down, and so the prepayment exposure might be characterized a lot differently on the balance sheet. Do you feel like that, in any way, drives your philosophy around leverage and capital allocation versus how you've managed in the past and how we should expect you guys to manage going forward? David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Well, certainly, the convexity profile of the agency portfolio is going to inform how we think about leverage. Right now, the agency average coupon, I think, is about 495. So we're below par. We have methodically gone up in coupon, as I talked about. And the convexity obviously has -- convexity exposure has increased, and it's now off a little bit or it's now a little bit better with the sell-off, but nevertheless, it is a consideration. And, Srini, feel free to elaborate on how we think about it from the overall managing the portfolio -- the agency portfolio standpoint. V.S. Srinivasan -- Managing Director, Head of Agency Yeah. I mean, to a large extent, we have gone up in coupon, but we have stayed in fairly high-quality specified pools as David alluded to in his opening remarks about 70% of our portfolio is in high-quality pools. So we don't have the same amount of duration drift that you would have if you are in lower quality -- if you're in generic pools. So given that the dollar price are generally higher for the quarter as rates rally, and the durations are lower, which means your hedging costs or your -- the amount of hedges you need against them is lower, it creates more liquidity. Eric Hagen -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. Yeah, that was a helpful explanation. Returning to the non-QM a little bit. You guys have been really active there. I mean how do you think that portfolio maybe benefits from the Fed cutting rates? And do you think lower rates will catalyze originators to create more non-QM? David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer We certainly hope so. We've been pretty happy with the growth of the correspondent channel as obviously, we discussed in the prepared remarks. Presumably, if you do get lower rates, it will spur more housing activity and certainly should benefit to non-QM. Oftentimes, the originators are in a lower rate environment, more focused on the agency market, but it feels like the market is in a healthy place and could grow as rates do come down. Eric Hagen -- Analyst Yeah. And with respect to the back book, I mean, how do you feel like the back book of non-QM might benefit from the Fed cutting rates since it's a fixed-rate portfolio? Mike Fania -- Deputy Chief Investment Officer and Head of Residential Credit Yeah. About -- Eric, this is Mike. About 85% of the portfolio is fixed rate, but we do look at that portfolio on a hedge basis. We're hedging that on a macro level with the MSR portfolio and with the agency portfolio as well. I do think that the majority of investors look at non-QM in terms of the AAA investors down to the BBB. They're looking at it on a spread basis and not necessarily a yield basis. So I think to the extent that rates do rally and there's a realization of these Fed cuts, I think it does put origination volumes up. Hopefully, it puts non-QM securitization volumes higher. And from a spread perspective, we do think once we get past some of these fall events, specifically the election that spreads could continue to tighten. So I think it's a conducive environment for us to the extent the Fed does ease as kind of the market predicts and you do see a little bit rally from here in rates. Eric Hagen -- Analyst Got you. Thank you, guys, very much. Thank you, Eric. Operator The next question will be from Harsh Hemnani from Green Street. Please go ahead. Harsh Hemnani -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst Thank you. Maybe in light of the Rocket Mortgage partnership and also perhaps the desire to grow the MSR book into the end of the year. Could you comment on how you're viewing relative value between sort of the higher coupon MSRs but with recaptured opportunities versus the lower coupon MSRs that are currently in the portfolio? David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Yeah, absolutely. Look, recapture, it's absolutely a component of valuation. And with the Rocket partnership, that's just another addition to our portfolio of recapture and subservicing partners. We're excited about the opportunity, given their leading customer retention rates and customer satisfaction. It's also been great to work with the Rocket team. Each of our partners has differing strategies and approaches to subservicing and recapture. So they are part of our portfolio, and we're prepared to opportunistically bid on the higher note rate or the lower note rate and building on our infrastructure just adds to this capacity. Harsh Hemnani -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst OK. Thank you. I'll leave it there. David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Thank you, Harsh. Operator The next question is from Jason Stewart from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead. Jason Stewart -- Janney Montgomery Scott -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to pull together the concept of offensive capital raising leverage in the election. And maybe if you could, David, put a pin in whether that's a signpost that would lead you to take leverage up? Or there other issues that you're looking at? And if you could just pull those three together for us and then maybe another signpost to take leverage up and how you're thinking about those? David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Yeah. So as it relates to raising capital, that's a better alternative been taking leverage up in our mind right now. The way we look at it is if you really like agency MBS you don't need to raise capital, you raise leverage. We do like agency MBS, but it was more advantageous to raise capital than to lever up because of all these all events on the horizon. Now if we fast forward a couple of weeks and we get an outcome on the election imminently after Tuesday, two weeks from now and the market calms down, we could certainly take leverage up because mortgages have cheapened about 4 to 5 basis points thus far in the quarter. They look perfectly reasonable, but wall is high, and we have to be respectful of it. And we don't need to take leverage up. We're certainly earning an adequate return. But if we feel like there's a tactical opportunity or even more intermediate-term opportunity to do so, we certainly have the capacity to do so, but we've got to see how things play out. Jason Stewart -- Janney Montgomery Scott -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. Thanks for taking the question. David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Thank you, Jason. Operator The next question is from Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Donald Fandetti -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about your sort of view on agency MBS spreads? I mean, I think they're still a little wide versus historical and the bull case is that maybe the banks come in and you could see some tightening. Do you subscribe to that? Or are you sort of more thinking we're range-bound for a while? Sean Kensil -- Director, Investor Relations So just stepping back, the big picture is that monetary policy that has been restrictive for a while has -- is now normalizing, along with labor markets and inflation. So from a fundamental perspective, I think you're likely to see the yield curve steepen up and interest rate volatility decline, all of which are positive for agency MBS. And what you alluded to, the supply demand technicals are better today than any time since 2022. Banks, which shed about $200 billion in 2023 have modestly added to MBS this year. So looking forward, I think if the Fed cutting cycle continues as we expect or as the Fed expects we should see an increase in bank demand, and we should also see foreign buyers coming into the agency MBS market. So the technical also looks pretty good for the agency MBS market. So we've been trading -- put some numbers on it. We've been trading in the 115- to 145-range -- basis-point range current coupon spread to blended treasury curve for the last four, five months. And I think as we get past the election and volatility subsides, we could see that spread tighten to 110- to 130-basis-point range. What we don't expect is that we'll go back to spreads, we saw pre-COVID which was closer to, say, 65 to 85 basis points when both the price with the Fed were actively involved. I think we will remain wide of those levels, but we could definitely tighten another -- the range has moved down by 10 to 15 basis points from where we are today. Donald Fandetti -- Analyst OK. Thank you. David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Thank you, Don. Operator [Operator instructions] The next question is from Trevor Cranston from Citizens JMP. Please go ahead. Trevor Cranston -- Analyst Hey, thanks. There was some news recently about a large asset manager making a move to get involved in the non-QM space. Could you guys maybe talk a little bit about generally what you guys are seeing in terms of new participants coming into the market and what that might mean for the competitive landscape and overall economics in non-QM space? Thanks. Mike Fania -- Deputy Chief Investment Officer and Head of Residential Credit Sure. Thanks, Trevor. I would say that we actually think it's a little bit of the opposite where entities that have fully scaled platforms with dedication of significant resources are in a really good spot right now. With where we're at, if you include October, we've already funded $9 billion of loans year to date. Now when you look at the market, it is hard to put a pin in what the actual origination volume is within non-QM and DSCR. But we think we're anywhere at a 10% to 15% market share. The market share that we're experiencing continues to increase. A lot of that is signing up new correspondents. We're signing up about 15 correspondents per each quarter. We've started to roll out additional originator tools, the ability to underwrite bank statement income. A lot of the capital raise that David talked about, we're putting a lot of those resources toward helping improve the velocity of funding loans. So I would say, it's actually a little bit of the opposite, Trevor. Like we actually feel is that we continue to gain market share and the margins that we're putting out on a daily basis where our rate sheet are increasing. So while you'll certainly always have participants and asset managers that want to participate in this product, without the extensive architecture that we put in place, without the infrastructure, the ability to phase 240-plus correspondents, it's hard to buy those assets at the same pricing that we have. So I think we've been ahead of the game. We launched this correspondent in 2021. We've been buying non-QM loans since 2016, 2017. So I think we've identified the opportunity a lot earlier than others, and I think we feel really good with kind of where we're at. David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Yeah. And then I'll just add, Trevor, there are huge barriers to entry in this space. We've -- Mike said, we started the correspondent channel in 2021. We've been in non-QM since around 2016. And we've been consistent, and we've been a durable partner to a lot of the originator community through COVID. We funded everything we committed to in 2022, as volatility hit in capital markets efforts among originators, we're in a precarious position. We were there for them. And as a consequence we have established very deep relationships in the originator community. Our infrastructure is as good as anybody's. We provide white-glove service to our partners, and we have the distribution through our securitization brand that leads to very competitive spreads. And as a consequence, the originator community gets better pricing and more durable commitments from us. So we feel like we're in a good place. Trevor Cranston -- Analyst Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. David L. Finkelstein -- Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer Thank you, Trevor. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Finkelstein for any closing remarks. David L.

[Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn it over to Dow investor relations vice president, Andrew Riker. Mr. Riker, you may now begin. Andrew Riker -- Vice President, Investor Relations Good morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I'm Andrew Riker, Dow's investor relations vice president. Leading today's call are Jim Fitterling, chair and chief executive officer; and Jeff Tate, chief financial officer. Please note our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statement contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risk and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release and slides that are posted on our website. On Slide 2, is our agenda for today's call. Jim will review our Q3 results, operating segment performance, and some key updates regarding the strategic asset review we announced today. Jeff will then share an update on the macroeconomic environment and provide fourth-quarter modeling guidance, followed by a discussion on our financial position and progress on Dow's growth investments. Jim will close the call and following that we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim. James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Andrew. Beginning on Slide 3, our cost advantage footprint in the Americas continues to provide strong competitive edge capturing demand growth in attractive markets and regions. In the third quarter, Team Dow delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth. We delivered this despite a soft macroeconomic environment, primarily in Europe and China, as well as an unplanned cracker outage in Texas, which has been successfully restarted and is running well. Net sales in the Q3 were $10.9 billion, this is up 1% versus the year-ago period led by higher demand and local prices in the United States and Canada. Volume increased 1% versus the year-ago period and prior periods. Sequentially, we saw gains in Packaging and Specialty Plastics and Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure. Local price was flat year over year as gains in Packaging and Specialty Plastics were offset by decreases in Performance Materials and Coatings. Sequentially, local price was down 1% due to minor declines across all segments. Operating EBIT was $641 million, up $15 million year over year, reflecting higher integrated margins in Packaging and Specialty Plastics, which were partly offset by the impact of the unplanned cracker outage in Texas and higher planned maintenance activity. Cash flow from continuing operations was $800 million down year over year, primarily due to higher inventories to support both sales growth and labor related supply chain disruptions. Shareholder remuneration for the quarter was $584 million including dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we progressed our long-term growth strategy including signing a long-term agreement with Linde for the supply of clean hydrogen for our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan. We also completed the acquisition of U.S.-based polyethylene recycler Circulus. This will add capacity of 50,000 metric tons of recycled materials annually to Dow's portfolio. Now turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment, local price increased year over year led by higher polyethylene prices in all regions except Latin America, which was flat. Volume was flat year over year as higher demand for functional polymers in all regions was offset by lower polyethylene volumes. Operating EBIT was $618 million an increase of $142 million year over year. This was primarily driven by higher integrated margins, which were partly offset by the impact of the unplanned cracker outage I mentioned earlier. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment, local price was flat year over year. In addition, volume was down 2%. This was driven by lower volumes in Polyurethanes and Construction chemicals, which were primarily due to a force majeure in MDI following a third-party supplier outage. Operating EBIT decreased $74 million versus the year-ago period. Results were driven by higher planned maintenance activity and lower integrated margins, which were partly offset by improved equity earnings. And in the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, local price declined year over year, while volume was up 5% with gains in both businesses and across all geographic regions. Operating EBIT was $140 million down $39 million compared to the year-ago period, driven by higher raw material costs, which were partly offset by higher volumes. Moving to Slide 5. The strength of Dow's differentiated portfolio is defined by our strategic and purpose-built asset footprint which leverages low-cost feedstock positions, primarily in the Americas. Our growth investments are concentrated in higher-value businesses and regions, particularly where demand is resilient and we have a competitive cost advantage. Over the past few years, we've demonstrated our commitment to operating with the best owner mindset by taking proactive actions with select higher-cost assets aligned with the evolving market dynamics. Since 2023, we have undertaken more than 20 asset actions. These include targeted rationalization of our global polyols capacity, shutting down our propylene oxide unit in Freeport, Texas in 2025 to reduce lower value merchant PO exposure, strengthening our coatings footprint with select asset closures and announcing the sale of our laminating adhesives business for $150 million including two manufacturing sites in Italy, which we expect to finalize in the fourth quarter of this year. Overall, these actions have been primarily focused on our industrial, intermediates, and infrastructure segment and in the EMEA region. On Slide 6, current market dynamics are impacting Europe, including continued soft demand, coupled with a persistent lack of long-term regulatory policy. This ongoing absence of clear, consistent, and competitive regulatory policy in Europe has resulted in many challenges for our industry. These challenges have been acknowledged in statements by EU government leaders, top economists, and our peers. And while a demand recovery in other parts of the world was expected to provide swift upside across the markets we serve, this alone is unlikely to be enough in Europe. Given these dynamics, we've begun a strategic review of select European assets, primarily those in our polyurethane business. This review includes all value-creating options for these assets and currently consists of approximately 20% of our sales in the EMEA region. We expect to complete this review by mid-2025. We continue to engage with governments both directly as well as through our leadership in trade associations to improve the industry's overall competitiveness in the region. Decisions regarding the strategic review, similar to our prior actions, will focus on strengthening Dow's global portfolio. This enables us to invest in the most attractive opportunities and create long-term value growth for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn it over to Jeff to review our outlook and guidance. Jeffrey L. Tate -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone joining our call today. Moving to Slide 7, we continue to experience muted demand across some end-markets and regions with the greatest pressure in Europe and China. Global manufacturing PMI has been decelerating over the past three months and consumer spending remains pressured by persistent inflation. That said, we're monitoring the impact of rate cuts in the U.S. and Europe, as well as recent stimulus plans in China to boost economic activity, which could provide some positive momentum for 2025. Looking specifically across our four market verticals, in packaging, domestic demand in North America is resilient and exports are robust, despite decelerating last month. Demand in Europe remains soft, consistent with manufacturing PMI at the lowest point year to date. In addition, China's manufacturing PMI returned to contractionary levels in September after improving in August. Infrastructure demand primarily in residential construction remains low. In the U.S., housing starts decelerated to negative 0.7% year over year in September. Eurozone construction PMI remained soft and new home prices in China declined year over year for the 15th consecutive month. Consumer spending has slowed across the globe, reflecting affordability challenges. We've seen consumer confidence weaken in the United States, remain negative in Europe, and decline in China for the fifth consecutive month. And in mobility, demand has softened globally. In the U.S., auto sales were slightly up year over year in September after decreasing in August. And in the EU, new car registrations declined in September after reaching a three-year low in August. China auto production declined for the fourth consecutive month, reflecting weak domestic demand, as well as exports due to tariffs imposed in Europe. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 8. We expect fourth-quarter earnings to be approximately $1.3 billion, up year over year and lower quarter over quarter, as normal seasonality plays out. Now looking into the sequential drivers by segment. In the packaging and specialty plastic segment, lower integrated margins stemming from higher feedstock costs and lower licensing revenue will be a headwind. Following an unplanned event in July, we restarted our Texas-8 cracker at the end of the third quarter, and we expect to ramp operating rates steadily throughout fourth quarter. This will generate an add-back of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter. We also expect lower planned maintenance activity across multiple sites along the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Europe to provide a tailwind sequentially. In the industrial, intermediates, and infrastructure segments, conditions remain mixed. Demand in building and construction end-markets, will be seasonally lower, but we expect the ongoing ramp of our plant at Louisiana operations, as well as the seasonal uptick in demand for deicing fluid, to offset this decline. In addition, we anticipate a $50 million tailwind through the lower planned maintenance activity along the U.S. Gulf Coast. And in the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, we see continued growth in downstream silicone applications across most end-markets. However, this is expected to be offset by ongoing weakness in the China property sector. In addition, lower seasonal demand for building and construction end markets is expected to be a headwind of approximately $125 million. Moving to Slide 9. Team Dow has built a very compelling investment opportunity even as our industry has faced volatile market conditions over the past few years. By continuing to execute our playbook, deliver on our financial priorities and advance our strategy, we are positioning Dow for long-term value growth. Importantly, we have built the financial flexibility to continue disciplined investment in areas that will raise our underlying earnings, reduce emissions, and advance customer circularity needs to drive growth. As it relates to our financial strength, Dow has ample liquidity and a strong investment grade-credit profile. Nearly all of our long-term debt is at a fixed rate and we have no substantive maturity until 2027. We also expect to enhance our near-term cash flow generation through the execution of unique to Dow cash flow levers And we are making solid progress on the evaluation of strategic options for our non-product producing infrastructure assets. As previously mentioned, we anticipate generating over $1 billion in proceeds from the transaction and we expect to share further progress yet this year. Dow's strong financial flexibility, allows us to advance our long-term growth strategy. Notably in the Q3, the team is making good progress on the construction of our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan. Major foundation work began and approximately 40% of cracker pilings are complete. Aligned to our capital deployment schedule for the project, we expect to receive more than $1.5 billion in cash and tax incentives with more than 80% received by 2030. Our near-term growth projects remain on track to deliver more than $2 billion of underlying EBITDA. This includes capacity expansions in silicones this year that will deliver approximately $70 million of annual EBITDA at full run rates. In our Transform the Waste strategy is expected to deliver more than $500 million of EBITDA by 2030. In the third quarter, we added new products to our growing circular portfolio. This includes REVOLOOP Recycled Plastic Resins that incorporate post-consumer recycled material into cable jacketing. We also introduced the First Bio Circular Engage REN polyolefin elastomers for carpet tile backing. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Jim. James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Closing on Slide 10. Despite persistent softness across many end-markets and regions, Dow continues to leverage our advantaged cost positions to capture areas of demand strength, operating with discipline, and invest for long-term profitable growth. Building on the more than 20 asset-related actions we've taken since 2023, today's announcement that we're undertaking a strategic review of select European assets is consistent with our best owner mindset and focused on long-term shareholder value creation. In addition, we're actively progressing unique to Dow cash flow levers, and expect to share more by the end of the year. Our solid financial foundation allows us to advance our long-term strategy, which is poised to deliver more than $3 billion in additional annual earnings growth by 2030. Dow is in a strong position to boost our core earnings as market conditions improve and we begin capturing the full benefits from our growth investments, thereby enabling greater returns to shareholders. With that, I will turn it back to Andrew to get us started with the Q&A. Andrew Riker -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Vincent Andrews -- Analyst Thank you and good morning, everyone. Wondering if I could just ask about the outlook for Packaging & Specialty Plastics in terms of pricing. If I'm reading the guidance correctly, it looks like on a net basis, pricing should be flat for the fourth quarter? Is that correct? And is there sort of the cadence of pricing you're expecting maybe up in October and then give a little bit back traditional in November and December? How are you thinking about it? James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Vince, yes, I think you are reading it overall correctly. We've got an outlook for flat pricing for the quarter, where you have got some obviously expectations that we might see some higher feedstock costs, but still very competitive feedstocks here in the U.S. Gulf Coast. I would think we've got moves out there announced for $0.03 in October and $0.03 in November. And I think our view is typically, that's when we tend to see the movement pricing up and then things soften toward the end of the year. Operator Your next question comes from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is now open. Hassan Ahmed -- Analyst Good morning, Jim. Just a question around some of the sort of review work that you guys are doing in Europe. You guys specifically talked about polyurethanes. I'm just trying to sort of get a better sense of all the moving parts with regards to how you see the polyurethane cycle sort of panning out. Obviously, we've seen or about to see some assets change hands within the global polyurethane market. The destocking was particularly severe in polyurethanes, but the supply side seems a bit tepid. So as sort of you sift through all of these moving parts, how do you see the polyurethane market sort of coming out on the other side? James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Hassan. Actually, we're still poised for a very good recovery in construction and durables markets, which really drive a lot of what's going on in polyurethanes. I'd add automotive on top of that because I think automotive has been under some pressure in Europe. So I agree with you, there is no signs that there's any stocking and destocking has run its course. But I think we are waiting for that obvious turn in the economy that gets people moving into those segments. And those assets in Europe is really a portfolio shift move. It really has nothing to do with the business. Polyurethanes is a good business, a pretty diverse downstream markets. We've got good positions there. And as I mentioned, we're thinking about 20 asset actions so far across the globe, mostly in II&I, which is really to tighten up the footprint and get our capacity focused on our lowest-cost assets there. So I think it is strengthened, both polyurethane business and also the coatings business as well. Operator Your next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Richard Garchitorena -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Good morning. This is Richard on for Mike. If I could just shift back to P&SP, I know it might be early, but given your comments on global integrated margins declining on a sequential basis in 4Q, how should we think about where margins and EBITDA for P&SP should be headed into 2025? What are the key puts and takes that we should look at? And how are you thinking about your global footprint and export growth rates? Thank you. James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, Michael, good question -- Richard, I'm sorry. Good question. On P&SP, we -- even -- despite the issues we have at Texas-8 in the third quarter, we still see strong volume growth downstream. So we were able to pull a lot of levers to make that happen. Demand is still good. I'd say, we had a little bit of a slowdown at the end of the quarter with exports because of the dock strikes that were going on at the time. But overall, downstream demand and volume has been good. So operating rates are continuing to tighten up and the cost advantage assets are running strong. As we look forward into 2025, I think you're going to see some continued growth in volume. So we are looking at about 3% organic growth and volume going into next year. We are going to see some benefit from higher operating rates. So from a basis of about $5.6 billion consensus for 2024, that would add maybe $400 million to that. We have add back for two unplanned events. We've got the full year Glycol-2 being fully ramped up, as well as the Texas-8 unplanned outage we had in the third quarter. So the add back of those two is about $300 million. And then from our growth investments, we've got about $150 million from polyethylene and functional polymers debottlenecks, incremental growth projects there. About $75 million from alkoxylates capacity that's coming on in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the full ramp-up of Thailand PG in Asia. And then about $75 million from Consumer Solutions, growth investments in debottlenecks. And they had a strong third quarter, with 6% year-over-year volume growth in silicones downstream specialty applications, so that's another $300 million there. So all-in-all, that's about $1 billion higher, and then you've got some upsides and downsides depending on things that would happen within the window. Operator Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Zekauskas -- Analyst Thanks very much. When you think about your Saskatchewan project, if -- you have a different production process in that you'll use the hydrogen, the autothermal reactor from Linde. So if ethane costs are the same, is the production cost in Fort Saskatchewan higher or lower than it is in Freeport? And if so, by how much? And secondly, do you still expect to bring on, I think, 600,000 tons of polyethylene in the U.S. in the second half of 2025? James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Jeff, the answer to your second question -- answer to the second question on 2025 additional incremental growth is, yes. In terms of Fort Saskatchewan, I would say we'll be advantaged on ethane in the Fort, and we believe our ethylene cost up in Canada will be some of the best in the world that we have. So I think it is going to be very similar. We do have, obviously, a little higher cost from running the autothermal reformer to produce that hydrogen that will go into fire the furnaces. However, we do get some of that back through CO2 sequestration, and we are going to be able to get some of that back to the market and selling of ethylene with zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions. So net-net, I think you're going to see returns equal or higher than Texas-9 in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which is our lowest-cost asset globally. Operator Thank you very much. Your next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Bhavesh Lodaya -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi. Good morning Jim, this is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. So it appears more and more likely that the U.S. and the world in general, is going to see more tariffs and duties being put in place. You have a low-cost advantage in the U.S., but there are also commodities like polyethylene, where you are very reliant on export markets. In Europe, I believe this is what you alluded to when you spoke about the regulatory actions required. So overall, if we enter this new era of source of more duties across the world, how do you think that plays out for Dow overall? James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Good morning Bhavesh. I think, look, we see tariffs today in some of the businesses that we participate in. And we are still a net exporter in general, out of the U.S. Gulf Coast because of the very strong competitive advantages that we have here. The large markets, China in particular, is still an importer and it's going to be an importer for quite some time. So I think that will exist. In most of the other markets, we are in the market to be a domestic player. So we're in Europe for Europe, and for the assets that we have in China, we are in China for China. There's a lot of discussion going on around tariffs. I think we are typically not in the crosshairs of some of the issues that are national security related. So I think that doesn't have a particular impact on us. And then we'll walk through what will happen with them. I would say, carbon border adjustment mechanisms are also -- could be considered a form of a tariff as well, and so we're going to stay eyes wide open to that. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. David Begleiter -- Analyst Thank you, good morning. Jim, on the European assets under review, are they EBITDA positive? And if so, how much? And if you do close both of your MDI plants in Europe, would you still look to supply Europe MDI from your plants in Saudi and Texas? Thank you. James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Good morning David. I don't have a specific number to give you on the European assets right now, but they are EBITDA positive. They are good cost positions in the European market. Again, we are looking at all value-creating opportunities. I don't believe -- I don't want to preclude anything, but I don't believe shutting down MDIS, that is going to be a value-creating opportunity, but we're going to look at everything. Operator Your next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Steve Byrne -- Analyst Yes. Thank you. Jeff, you made a comment about your customers for P&SP have circularity needs. Are those needs, in your view intensifying? Or are they waning in these days? And is it sufficient to give you the ability to enter into long-term contracts? Your guide for this $3 billion EBITDA gain by 2030 is presumably pulling a chunk out of the Alberta project, but is -- what gives you that confidence to offset those costs with higher returns? Can you get longer-term contracts with your customers for low-carbon polyethylene? Jeffrey L. Tate -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Steve. Yeah, good question. From our standpoint, we still feel very confident in our ability to be able to generate, again overall for our Transform the Waste strategy, at least $500 million of additional earnings by 2030. And there's no assumptions right now that we see in the marketplace that would have us that would look at that any differently. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chris Parkinson -- Analyst Great. Good morning, everyone. Can we just take a step back and take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow and just the year-to-date trends? Some of your commentary pertaining toward the end of the third quarter going to the fourth in terms of facilitating growth. And just any framework in terms of the puts and takes that the Street should be considering as we progress into 2025? Thank you so much. Jeffrey L. Tate -- Chief Financial Officer Hi. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for the question. For us when we look at third quarter, we generated $800 million in cash flow from operations, which gave us an almost 60% conversion rate, which led to actually positive free cash flow in the quarter, which is pretty similar in terms of the range that we had for second quarter. So we've seen some stability there. A couple of other puts and takes that I think are important is that we've been able to maintain our cash conversion cycle at 42 days, which is top quartile in comparison to our peers. And so that's an eight-day improvement that we've been able to achieve versus pre-COVID levels. Another thing that's important here is that our cash balance at almost $3 billion, as well as the additional liquidity that we have of another $10 billion, gives us total liquidity of $13 billion to date, and we have no subsequent debt maturities due until 2027. And the other thing I would also remind you of Chris, is the fact that we continue to make the commitment of unique to Dow cash levers and being able to deliver at least $1 billion of those cash levers here each and every year, and we still maintain that commitment moving forward. Operator Your next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is now open. Josh Spector -- UBS -- Analyst Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about all the actions that you've done around some of the portfolio changes and some of the asset closures? And just talk about the earnings impact combined. I'm thinking about this more in relation where Dow talks about the earnings corridor, $8 billion to $9 billion in EBITDA potential. If we look at what you've done versus the last five years, 10 years of earning those assets, how much of a negative is there in that bridge that we should be building in? Or maybe it's smaller or less than what we expect? Thanks. James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Josh, good question. I think you should look at it in terms of what are we doing to keep our cost position low. We've typically been able to bring all that capacity into lower-cost assets and run them at higher rates, and so you'll see that improvement in operating rate lead to bottom-line improvements. And although some of these have happened in 2023 and '24, we've had some costs associated with getting out of these assets. You'll start to see some positive impact of that as we move forward into 2025. We're typically able to supply all of that, run the existing assets harder. Those are lower-cost assets as we move forward. So I think it's more of a tightening up the footprint, making the portfolio more attractive. If you look at where we are year over year, we've had an improvement in operating rates of about 500 basis points. In the third quarter, we were up about 100 basis points, and that was because we moved out some maintenance activity in the quarter. So continuing to move that operating rate up will have an impact on bottom line. Operator Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Kevin McCarthy -- Analyst Yes. Thank you and good morning. Jim, two questions on Europe, maybe one broad one and one more narrow. Just broadly, I think it stands to reason that margins are lower in the region due to higher energy cost, anemic demand, and some of the onerous regulations that you spoke to in the prepared remarks and in the press release. So I guess my general question would be, if you were to report margins on a regional basis rather than on a segment basis, how much lower would Europe be relative to the Americas or even Asia? Number one. And then number two, as you go through the strategic review, do you have in mind, potential financial consequence of that in terms of the EBITDA uplift or narrowing that margin gap? Thanks. James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Good morning, Kevin. Good question on Europe. While energy costs are higher, they have come back down and moderated a bit. And so they are going to -- I think you are going to see that new kind of relative competitive floor being based on import LNG into Europe, and we're kind of at that level right now. And they've got -- they've diversified their base away from just the Russian gas that they've had before. So I think that's a positive -- relative positive. We've got a good line of sight to what the energy costs will be there. Demand has been lower. I think construction obviously has been slower. The consumer has been slower. Automotive has seen some pressure from import EVs, as we know. But I think, obviously they will have to adjust to that. I would say when you look at the businesses, obviously I think the biggest delta and where we are right now versus where we were say, in 2020 at the low point in the cycle is the higher cost position of Europe. I think that's a pretty easy way to take a look at it. These businesses, mid-cycle and polyurethanes and construction chemicals, their mid-cycle EBITDA margins are about 15%. And so I think, our view here is to look at portfolio options where we can invest more money in businesses that have higher returns and higher downstream growth rates. The European assets that we're talking about with polyurethanes, make up about 20% of our existing EMEA sales. Operator Your next question comes from Patrick Cunningham from Citi. Your line is now open. Patrick Cunningham -- Citi -- Analyst Yes. Hi. Good morning. So just on the review of the European assets, what would you need to see from a policy perspective to maintain and run these assets? And then across -- are you positioning with governments and trade organizations regarding the sort of an idiosyncratic risk related to U.S. backing the UN Global Plastics treaty, particularly the plastics production cap? James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Patrick. Good questions. First on European policy, clearly, I think there are a couple of differences. So in energy, I think, a forward focus on what Europe needs to do to be energy competitive is critical. Also, I think a look at, and a good comparison would be Canada with Fort Saskatchewan and Europe's position on hydrogen. We call the Fort project circular hydrogen in order to run, and we're able to make ethylene from that circular hydrogen at competitive costs with U.S. Gulf Coast economics and also get a benefit from selling Zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions products into the market. The way the UGreen deal is written today, it says that you can only get credit for green hydrogen, which means made by electrolyzers, made with alternative energy or low carbon energy. If I give you a comparison on what would have to happen in Fort Saskatchewan, if I were to have to make green hydrogen to run that asset, I'd have to have 7 gigawatts of electricity, running electrolyzers to make all the green hydrogen to run the Fort. It is just simply not economical, and it won't happen. And so now you've seen there are no projects now moving forward on blue hydrogen. There's no projects moving forward for carbon capture and all these things that were on the table in terms of helping European industry decarbonize are just so far uncompetitive, that not only will the industry not decarbonized, they'll probably have to consider other alternatives. In the United States, well in terms of the international legally binding agreement on plastics, I think we're making tremendous progress. There is certainly no alignment around the world on production caps or bands in that agreement. We think we're all surprised by the shift in positioning of the administration, but we're not at the end of this process yet. And so we continue to advocate that we focus on the issue, which is plastic pollution, focus on the solutions, which are circularity policies, recycled content mandates, extended producer responsibility schemes, all forms of recycling and dealing with the pollution part of the situation. Plastics are the lowest carbon footprint products that are out there. They are easiest to use, they're the cheapest to use. They have the best sustainability footprint. And as we convert to making them with Zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions like we're going to do at the Fort, nothing -- no alternative will be able to touch the sustainability footprint. Operator Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is open. Frank Mitsch -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Jim, I appreciate your answer to the question on tariffs earlier in the Q&A with the U.S. Gulf Coast competitive advantage. I'm curious, Brazil just enacted an increase from 12.5% to 20% on polyethylene imports. What specifically may be seeing in that region? And perhaps if you could also offer an early look at 2025 in terms of siloxanes, the interplay between supply and demand, that would be helpful. Thank you. James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Frank. Good questions. Sorry about the Mets. I'm with you there with the Royals, not making it as well. 12.5% to 20% I think, in the case of Brazil, I think you have to look at tariffs in terms of are you trying to protect the manufacturing in the domestic economy so that you keep a manufacturing base. And I think tariffs of 12.5% to 20%, like you see in Brazil, are meant to do that. I think when you've heard reference to tariffs here in the United States, of maybe a base tariff of 10% for anything that's imported, yes, I think that's driven by a mindset that we're trying to get manufacturing into the United States, not resort to a neighboring country, but into the United States. And so we see tariffs around the world for countries that are trying to protect local manufacturing and trying not to be completely at the mercy of import materials for all of the needs for their economy. I think we're going to continue to see a lot of focus on that and actions like that. On siloxanes, we saw a little bit of tightening and a little bit of pricing improvement. I think we're a ways away. I think we are still in the area where there's opportunity for some rationalization. We've got Chinese capacity that's at negative cash margins right now. The downstream is growing well. As I mentioned, we were up 6% year over year in the downstream. The continued outlook for the downstream market is good, even though automotive has been slow, like vehicle production this year is going to be projected to be about 2% lower year over year. The growth in electric vehicles has been strong, like 13%, 14%. And when you look at that, that drives a lot of silicones demand. And when we start to see construction come back, that's a high-volume use, and I think you're going to see that pull on it as well. So I think it's a combination of those big volume markets coming back, as well as some assets that are in the cash-negative territory having to be taken down. Operator Your next question comes from John Roberts of Mizuho. Your line is now open. John Roberts -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst Thank you. Jim, you've got chlorine integration in Europe. So how separable are the decisions you're looking at in Europe for polyurethanes versus the cab assets? James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer They're not, John. Obviously, we're not going to do anything without close contact with our own chlorine assets but also with our partners in Europe. And so we'll keep a close eye on that. Chlorine PO integration is critical for us, and so we will make sure we're eyes wide open to that. Operator Your next question comes from Mike Leithead of Barclays. Your line is now open. Mike Leithead -- Barclays -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Question maybe for Jeff around 2025. It seems like Jim earlier talked about $1 billion of year-over-year improvement in EBITDA [Inaudible] $6.6 billion -- budget cash outflows in 2025. Between $3 billion capex and $2 billion dividend, interest, taxes and the like. So are there further you need to unique cash items you'd expect next year? Or should we expect net debt to remain relatively flat? Just how should we think about net cash flow next year, and sort of how does this impact the pacing of your buyback activity from here? Jeffrey L. Tate -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. Short answer on the unique-to-Dow cash levers is yes. We would expect to have a similar type of proceed coming back from some of the activities that we are focused on. Some of those that we've mentioned in the past that we're still working on, besides the non-product producing infrastructure assets, would be looking at our Nova judgment and continuing to make progress on that, as well as looking at some of our joint venture restructuring activities that could also give us some cash opportunities. And so with those unique to Dow cash levers, plus expecting our cash conversion rates to be similar or higher versus what we had this year, coming off of whatever our 2025 ultimate EBITDA plan is, will give us the opportunity to be able to support our cash uses for 2025. Operator [Technical Difficulty] Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Duffy Fischer -- Analyst Yeah. Good morning. Just a couple of questions around the licensing income. So one, how much bigger was it than you expected when you gave guidance after Q2? And then two, was it an unexpected project that came in? Or is it just pulling forward either from the Q4 or next year's cycle? James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Duffy, it is just timing on -- those are driven by delivery of engineering packages and timing on milestones. I'd say it's relatively small in terms of the beat on P&SP. A big chunk as well was moving in St. Charles Cracker turnaround out. As you remember, we were coming off of hurricane -- that turnaround was due to start around the time we were having all the hurricane activity. So we just decided to move it into first quarter just so we could deal with hurricane-related issues and not have to focus on that while we were trying to make the quarter. But I think it was relatively small in the grand scheme of things. Operator Your next question comes from Matthew Blair from TPH. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair -- Analyst Thank you and good morning. You mentioned you're expecting higher cracking feedstocks in the fourth quarter. I was hoping you could expand a little bit on what you're seeing in the U.S. ethane market. Do you think that the wider frac spreads that we are seeing so far this quarter are temporary or perhaps structural? And then would Dow expect to enjoy a little bit of an offset here the Devon JV? And is there any appetite to expand that JV with Devon? Thanks. James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good questions. And I would say as we look forward, the winter strip on ethane is very similar to where the summer was. Our range on ethane probably for the quarter is in $0.19 to $0.23 range. The frac spreads have been consistently at $0.50 or below. So I think we are probably going to see that continue. Natural gas has obviously been very positive for this as we've had good production, and the hurricanes in the third quarter took some export capability out. I think we're going to see some of that export capability come back in, which is why I think you're going to see some competition for that gas that we didn't see in the third quarter. All that, I think, is around the edges. I think we still got very, very cost advantaged positions. And then what was the second? Matthew Blair -- Analyst Devon. James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer On Devon. Yes, look we've been very happy with the partnership with Devon. We started that back in 2021 and continue to ramp that up in 2023. Right now, we've done 114 wells with them, and we've got 15 additional ones expected to come online this year. It continues to grow to help us offset our exposures. Obviously, the way we work that deal is we trade that into the market, so it's a net offset to our cost coming in. And we continue to be very happy with it. It's worked well for both of us. It is a strong partnership, and I think we are looking forward to continuing it. Operator Your next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Aleksey Yefremov -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jim, I was quite surprised to see about $100 million in EBITDA for II&I into this quarter. The segment started the year pretty strongly with $234 million, and then EBITDA continued to soften. Could you give us, just to reflect on this year, what product specifically or regions maybe did not perform as well? And what do you expect next year here? James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So obviously, we had Glycol-2 up and running, so that was to a positive. We had price pressure on PO Polyols and we had lower volumes in MDI. I mentioned in the opening that we had a third-party outage in North America, which supplied industrial gas to our MDI process there, the plants back up but still running at lower rates. And then look, the other thing that happened when Texas-8 was out, Texas-8 produces propylene for us as well. And so when we had Texas-8 out, we had to go into the market to get some of that propylene so that was a higher cost. So I think it was on to one-time, the MDI issue is a one-time, which will correct itself. The PO polyols that was a big driving force around the decision to tighten up the footprint in Freeport. So as we go forward, we don't have as much length in PO, which brings the North American market more in the balance. So I think, as we move forward, it is polyurethanes in North America, that was the bigger slowdown and drag in the quarter. Operator Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Laurence Alexander -- Analyst Good morning. Just on the unique to Dow cash levers, can you give a sense for what the longer-term pipeline looks like say through 2030 or even farther out? After the ones that you've publicly disclosed, I mean how bare is the covered? Jeffrey L. Tate -- Chief Financial Officer Well, Laurence, this is Jeff. Going out to 2030, we wouldn't be able to get too definitive at this stage. I mean, as we continuously go through our annual reviews of all of our assets and all of our opportunities, we'll continue to identify those things that could create more value across the enterprise and have a best of our mindset as we approach it. But the ones that I've noted in the earlier question around some of the things that are more near-term, are the ones that we've specifically identified that will bring us more of that near-term impact. But going out to 2030, I couldn't give you anything specific at this point, but we'll continue to again, maintain that commitment of well over $1 billion on an annual basis. Operator Your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan -- Analyst Hi, guys. Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess I just wanted to ask about -- there's been a lot of portfolio reviews, especially of European assets at this point. So just wondering if you've gone through some kind of analysis here, assuming any of those shutdowns happen or potentially portfolio reviews result in shutdowns. How much maybe capacity could be coming out of the industry and P&SP in -- as you look into '25. And maybe if you can give us your thoughts as well on PMC kind of global supply demand as well, just because we've been mired in weakness on the coating side for a while, from a demand standpoint, but maybe there is some green shoots with rates coming down. So do you see any improvement in operating rates on the PMC side as well. So just maybe you could get your comments on both P&SP and PMC utilization as you look into '25? Thanks. James R. Fitterling -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Good morning, Arun. Look, I think, again, our portfolio work in Europe is around polyurethanes. And as I mentioned before, it really isn't driven primarily by shutdowns, we'll look at that. But I think we've done a lot to bring smaller assets down and bring that capacity into our low-cost locations. It's really looking at what is there a better owner for the portfolio? Does that allow us to continue to focus on our Invest for Growth businesses, which went from Investor Day, you'll remember we're P&SP our silicones business, and also our Industrial Solutions business. In P&SP in Europe, we have good positions, and we're focused on the domestic market there. So I think our focus there is continuing to make those assets more competitive. There has been about -- and I'm doing this off the top of my head, about 1.5 million metric tons of announcements made already in the industry, on shutdowns that are coming in Europe. I think we'll probably continue to see that in isolated stand-alone cases where you may be facing an older asset that has some high-cost maintenance or other life extension work that needs to happen. So that will be a challenge. I think in most of those asset cases, there was a discussion of cash flow losses for a number of years before those decisions were taken. We're not in that situation in P&SP in Europe. I think on coatings, even though coatings has been slow, we've had really good volume growth this year, growing with our strategic customers, well ahead of what was expected in the marketplace. And I think that will mostly shift as we start to see things pick up in the housing sector and the architectural coatings pick up. We had a lot of growth in traffic paint coatings this year, infrastructure-related. There's a lot of development going on in space there to make road markings that can actually communicate with the future for autonomous vehicles or the autonomous and lane assist type of devices that are put on your vehicles today are requiring some better road markets to be able to -- for them to react with the cars. So I think we'll continue to see growth in both of those, but the housing market will be the big pickup on the coatings business. Coatings is doing well. I'd say monomers is where things need to tighten up a little. Operator This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to hand back over to Andrew Riker for closing remarks.

[Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Lyndsey Burton, vice president of investor relations. Thank you. You may begin. Lyndsey Burton -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you, and good morning, everyone. In addition to the earnings release that we issued yesterday, the company has also prepared a supporting slide presentation. The earnings release and presentation are available on our website at www.rollins.com. We have included certain non-GAAP financial measures as part of our discussion this morning. The non-GAAP reconciliations are available in the appendix of today's presentation as well as in our earnings release. The company's earnings release discusses the business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that will be made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to yesterday's press release and the company's SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. On the line with me today and speaking are Jerry Gahlhoff, president and chief executive officer; and Ken Krause, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Jerry, would you like to begin? Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. We would like to begin our discussion today by offering our support and encouragement to all of those who have been impacted by the recent hurricanes. I am proud of the way our team has worked together to support our teammates and the communities we serve in the aftermath of these disasters. The Rollins Relief Fund has processed over 250 emergency grants for teammates in need, and we continue to direct truckloads of food, water and other necessities to impacted areas. Our efforts will continue in the days, weeks and months ahead as these communities begin to recover. Turning to our financial results. Our team delivered another solid quarter, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our team delivered these results despite some operational disruption caused by Hurricane Helene, which occurred during the last week of the quarter. Our financial performance for the third quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of 9% to $916 million, and we delivered healthy organic growth of 7.7% in the quarter. Overall, we continue to see solid revenue growth across all major service lines. We continue to invest in growing our business and adding to our customer base as the markets we serve remain strong. We invested significantly in incremental sales staffing and marketing activities in Q3, and we're well staffed to convert quality leads and sales efforts into new customer growth, which our results in the quarter reflect. On the commercial side of the business, we continue to make long-term investments to capitalize on the growth opportunities in a multibillion-dollar B2B market. Our commercial division continues to strategically add feet on the street to our sales force, and we are leveraging data analytics and training to better enable their success. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. We closed 32 tuck-in deals in the first nine months of the year, and the M&A pipeline remains healthy. We're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally and remain on track to deliver at least 2% of growth from M&A activity in 2024. Beyond growth, our dedication to operational efficiency and continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. Ken will discuss in more detail, but investments we made to support long-term growth objectives did temper margins a bit in the quarter, but we remain on track to deliver healthy margin improvement and profitability for the year. In yesterday's release, we also announced a planned leadership transition at our board of directors. In accordance with the company's long-term leadership succession plan, Gary Rollins will transition from executive chairman to executive chairman emeritus, and John Wilson will succeed him as executive chairman of the board. Gary was elected to a 3-year term during our 2024 Annual Meeting and will continue to be an active and engaged member of our board. John has been with our company since 1996 in various positions of increasing responsibility. I've known John for 20 years, and his experience and guidance have been invaluable to me as I have transitioned to the role of CEO over the last two years. I look forward to continuing to work with John, Gary and the rest of our board as we position our company for continued success in the future. In closing, we're excited about where our business stands today. Our markets are solid, staffing levels are healthy and our team is focused on driving continuous improvement and profitable growth. I want to thank each of our 20,000-plus teammates around the world for their ongoing commitment to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. We are now nine months into 2024, and we've delivered solid financial results. Year to date, we've delivered double-digit improvement across all major P&L metrics year over year and EBITDA margin improvement of 50 basis points despite making significant investments in the business here in Q3. Cash flow continues to be strong with free cash flow growing nearly 12% year to date, enabling a 10% increase to our dividend, which we announced earlier this week. With this increase, we have raised our regular dividend by approximately 65% since the beginning of 2022 while continuing to meaningfully invest in the growth of our business. This is a reflection of our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders and the confidence we have in our future. Looking closer at the third quarter. Our team executed exceptionally well and delivered Q3 revenue growth of 9% year over year, with organic growth of 7.7%, at the high end of the 7% to 8% range we've discussed this year. We delivered good growth across each of our service offerings. In the third quarter, residential revenues increased 6.4%, commercial pest control rose 9.4% and termite and ancillary increased by 14.5%. Organic growth was also healthy across the portfolio with growth of 4.9% in residential, 81.% in commercial and 13.7% in the termite and ancillary area of our business. Turning to profitability. Our gross margins were 54%, up 20 basis points versus last year. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation. Pressures from incremental people investments were offset by leverage in materials and supplies as well as fleet. Quarterly adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue increased by 100 basis points versus last year. This was primarily driven by incremental investments in people to support our growth initiatives and the uptick in advertising spend that we expected and previously discussed during our Q2 earnings call. Third quarter GAAP operating income was $192 million, up 8.3% year over year. Operating margins were 20.9%, down 20 basis points year over year. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $219 million, up over 5% and representing a 24% margin. Margins were down 80 basis points versus last year, and adjusted incremental EBITDA margins were 15.1% in the quarter, reflecting incremental investments in people and growth programs during the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 26.1% in the quarter, and we continue to expect an ETR of approximately 26% for the year, which implies a rate that is just over 27% for the fourth quarter. Quarterly GAAP net income was $137 million or $0.28 per share, increasing 7.7% from $0.26 per share in the same period a year ago. Accounting for certain non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted net income for the quarter was $140 million or $0.29 per share, increasing nearly 4% from the same period a year ago despite a higher level of interest costs and the investments we are making and growth-oriented initiatives. We remain on track to deliver healthy profitability for the full year driven by solid growth and an improving margin profile. We continue to focus on driving further improvements while investing in our business and capturing growth in our very attractive end markets. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly cash flow was $139 million, up a very healthy 16% versus last year. Free cash flow conversion was 102% for the quarter and 110% year to date. We made acquisitions totaling $24 million, and we paid $73 million in dividends in the quarter. Year to date, we have made acquisitions of $106 million and returned $218 million to shareholders through our dividend. Additionally, we had just announced a 10% increase to our dividend earlier this week. This represents over two decades of consecutive increases in annual dividend payments. Debt to EBITDA leverage is well below one times on a gross and net level. Our balance sheet is healthy, and we are well positioned and committed to continue to maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation. In closing, we continue to focus on investing for growth while executing on our continuous improvement and modernization initiatives. We are starting the last quarter of the year with healthy organic demand, and we remain committed to investing in our people and providing our customers with the best customer experience. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time.

Tim Mulrooney -- Analyst Ken, Jerry, good morning. Greetings from pest world. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Wish we were there. Tim Mulrooney -- Analyst Wish you guys were out here too. Don't worry, we're not having any fun without you. So residential organic, I wanted to ask about that. It's five -- I guess 5% year to date. Still indicative of a healthy market, I recognize that, but maybe slightly below what we've seen over the last several years. So I'm just curious, how would you characterize the health of the consumer today? And could you maybe break that growth down between your recurring revenue stream and one-time sales? Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Sure, Tim. Thanks for the question. We appreciate that. When we dive in and we look at the overall growth of the business, we continue to remain very optimistic, very confident in our outlook. We talked about 7% to 8%. We delivered 7.7% here in the quarter and 7.7% organic growth year to date. When you look closer at the residential business, it's an area that we're also pretty pleased with the performance, especially when we look at the recurring revenue in the business. Back in September, we spoke on a public webcast and talked about the fact that we were seeing six-plus percent recurring revenue growth coming through the residential sector. And that's where we finished. That's where we've been for the better part of the year. And so we're pretty pleased with that level of of recurring revenue growth, especially in the residential sector. When I look at the business in the quarter, Jerry pointed out the fact that unfortunately we all had to deal with the effects of the hurricane late in the quarter. But if you set that aside and you look at what happened as a result of that hurricane, it probably had about a $2 million or so impact on revenue growth. And so we would have probably delivered organic growth that would have been slightly higher than the 7.7%, closer to the high end, the 8% that we have talked about in the business. So overall, we remain very pleased with the performance. The team is doing an exceptional job at delivering yet another quarter. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer And the health of the residential consumer does appear still strong to us. We see good growth in termite and ancillary, a good acceptance of our cross-sell campaigns and other things. So if there's anything that's been more inconsistent, it's the one-time piece. And the residential recurring, that's what we're really investing in with marketing, trying to drive quality leads. That's what we invest in with door-to-door, and any other type of channel that we go to is to try to create recurring revenue streams. And the investments we made in the third quarter will pay off for us in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year as our customer base is bigger as we head into the back end of the year. Tim Mulrooney -- Analyst OK. That's a lot of helpful color. Thank you. I'm just going to switch gears really quickly because, Ken, I think I remember having a conversation with you a couple of months ago about really like when you're looking at incremental margins, you're really trying to hit that in that target range, not any particular quarter but more like if you look at it on an LTM basis, right? So that's kind of how we're analyzing the business, thinking about it from that standpoint. So I guess my question is, if we look at incremental margins on an LTM basis, do you expect them to be essentially in line with your target range for the full year this year? Or might that be different given the incremental investments? Thank you. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Thanks for the question, Tim. We continue to remain confident in our outlook on incremental margins. With a business that's generating gross margins of 54%, we feel like the contribution or the incremental margins should be approximating that 30% level. And in fact, when you look at the quarter and you peel back the performance, you unpack the performance a little bit and look at it a little bit closer, what you see is that we spent more in selling and marketing. We saw an opportunity in a very attractive growth market to invest and grow our business, and just alluding to what Jerry just spoke about. So we spent a little bit more there. If you set that aside, along with some of the investments we made on the tech side to accelerate the start rate that we have in our business, you'd see an incremental margin that would be right around 30% here in the quarter. So we continue to remain confident in our ability to deliver 30% plus incremental margins longer term. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, this quarter is more of a timing issue more than anything as we indicated at the end of Q2. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Yes. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Toni Kaplan -- Analyst Thank you so much. I also wanted to ask about margin. You mentioned the growth investments and hiring more people. Should we expect further investment in future quarters? Or was this more of a catch up to where you want to be? And just if you could talk about which segments you're investing in most and that would be the best. That would be great. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Sure. Thanks for the question, Toni. When we look at the investments, this is a growth business. It's a growth market. We continue to see great growth opportunities. So we're going to continue to invest in the business. When I go back and unpack the investments we made this quarter, I would look at them through two or three lenses. One is on our service side and our service technicians. Because we know the importance of getting out and starting our lead -- getting our leads converted into starts, we have certainly invested in the service side of our business. That's probably about a 30-basis-point headwind on gross margins in the quarter. The second area that we made investments here is in our sales and our sales engine and our sales people. We've talked about the fact that our commercial business remains a very important area of our business combined with our residential. And so we're investing disproportionately in the sales end of our business, and you saw that come through along with the increased advertising spend that we had here in the quarter to the tune of about 100 basis points. So you probably don't expect that level of investment every single quarter, but you're going to see us invest in this business following the various strategic initiatives that we talked about back at our investor day back in May. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer And to add a little color to that, when I look back at Q3 of 2023 compared to 2024 on our staffing levels, just thinking -- just peeling back to just Orkin in itself. You think on the commercial side, we are looking at the data to say, hey, where do we have adequate coverage given the market, and we're going to continue to invest where that opportunity is there. If it gets difficult to scale, or the data sets that we've got good penetrated -- the penetration that we need and we have the right people and the right places for where the opportunities are, that will certainly slow down. But we'll let the data and then how we're doing operationally from a scalability standpoint will help us dictate that. And then on the residential side, selling termite, cross-sell, ancillary business, those kinds of things, that staffing is up double digits just like the commercial side is as we continue to make those investments there. And the opportunities there, the consumer is taking the services and buying the services, as you see in our results. And we find that to be a very worthwhile investment, and we'll continue to do that so long as the market holds it. Toni Kaplan -- Analyst Perfect. And I wanted to ask about pricing as we approach the end of the year and thinking about your strategy into next year. I think we've been in a little bit of a unique environment in the last couple of years in terms of we had the inflation and then it's been cooling. So I know we've been a little bit on the higher side on price in the past couple of years. Do you see that sort of higher-than-normal price level of increases continuing into 2025 when you're looking at your data and stuff like that? Just how are you thinking about it? Thank you. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So Ken and I just recently spent hours in a room together reviewing those data from our price increase results this year. And there's not been anything in there that -- in the data from what we see and what we understand about the consumer that scares us off of continuing to get a fair price for our service. And if we're doing a good job, we should be rewarded for that, and our technicians in the field should be rewarded for that as well. So we've not seen anything in the data that would cause us to change course from anything that we've already indicated to you. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer No, both internally but also externally. When you look at CPI, we've consistently talked about CPI plus level of pricing. And CPI coming back roughly 2.5% recently gives us no reason to step back on the pricing and pare that back. We feel like this is an essential service, and we should be able to be rewarded. And we should be able to reward our service technicians with the pricing that we've seen in the last couple of years. Toni Kaplan -- Analyst Very clear. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Audey Ashkar -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey guys. This is Audey Ashkar on for Jason Hass. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to ask on the commercial side. Just any update there in terms of the strategy around splitting the brands and adding to the sales force? I think there's eventual plans to create a second division. And can you just remind us there of the margin opportunity being able to capitalize on multiple branches across a single digital media channel? Thank you. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. We still continue to have a pretty long runway on the commercial side and how we structure that business, how we open new branches. And to your point about opening another division, those types of things, we're still in -- probably in the first two or three innings of what's possible there on the commercial side, and we're going to continue to invest in those opportunities. And even from a margin standpoint, the commercial side tends to drive some stickier customer base and just -- and a very appealing margin opportunity there as well on that side of the business. So we see nothing but good things from the future on that commercial strategy. And we're just, like I said, still in the early stages. Audey Ashkar -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Awesome. That's great to hear. And then just if you can maybe talk about the trends you're seeing in commercial between the national accounts and the SMEs. And just wondering of your guys take on advertising for SMEs relative to the resi side of the business, maybe differences or similarities that you would call out there? Thank you. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer I don't think there's been anything -- any sort of significant shift in that space how -- from a competitive standpoint, I think we've been making a more conservative effort, especially within the Orkin brand to focus on the commercial side and our marketing strategy there. And we've allocated more dollars into the commercial space ourselves to do that. But I don't think there's been any significant shift in the competitive environment or anything along those lines from an advertising standpoint or a go-to-market strategy that we've seen. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer The team continues to do well. Scott Weaver is heading up our business in Orkin in the commercial side and we're seeing nice results there. But also I was just talking to our business leader, Rob Quinn yesterday up in Canada, and he's talking about the good performance we're seeing coming out of our Canadian commercial business and... Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Mostly a commercial business. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Substantially all commercial. And so really good results across both of those markets. Audey Ashkar -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Got it. Thanks guys. Very helpful color. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. David Paige -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi. This is David Paige on for Ashish. Congrats on the good results. A question on termite and ancillary or just other maybe untapped potential in the residential space that you -- I guess, that the company is looking to capitalize outside of the current operators that you have. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. We're always looking for new services and new opportunities in and around the home that we can maybe expand to. And some of those are geographic in nature based on construction type of the house or certain types of pests and things like that. So there haven't been anything -- there's nothing revolutionary that we've seen other than the continuation of adding more sales staff to increase the number of customers with more than one service for us. And that's why we continue to be so successful adding our home sales inspectors to offer those types of ancillary services. And another great opportunity is selling more recurring termite. We have a lot of customers that have pest control that don't have termite control that we can continue to offer that service to through cross-marketing, cross-selling campaigns. So we're pretty good at sticking to what works. There's so much opportunity there, and we're just continuing to invest and drive that part of the business. David Paige -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks. And just a follow-up on -- in terms of inorganic investment, given the robust free cash generation, the low debt leverage. Anything we should keep in mind for there in terms of verticals or geographies that you'd be targeting? Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer No, nothing noteworthy there other than we're going to continue to deploy capital and M&A. We continue to have a focus on delivering 2% to 3% of revenue growth from M&A each year. Markets remain very healthy, an incredibly attractive market, so you certainly do have competition from time to time. But we've been able to separate ourselves by how we treat the acquisitions that we bring into the fold and how we treat the teams and the brands. And that's a meaningful difference for us in our markets. But in terms of new markets, we see so much opportunity. It's such a fragmented, such a large and growing market, the pest control market, that we're going to continue to remain committed to that area. David Paige -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. George Tong -- Analyst Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You mentioned seeing disruptions to operations from Hurricane Helene during the last week of the quarter. Can you discuss which parts of the business this impacted the most and whether you expect any spillover effect in 4Q? Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer So it was really the -- obviously, the Southeast United States, the coastal areas of Florida where we have a strong presence, both in the Orkin brands as well as brands like HomeTeam in Northwest, all up the West Coast of Florida and parts of the East Coast of Florida too as that storm had pushed through and had tornadoes in the southeast and central part of the Eastern Coast of Florida. So there was a lot going on there. We had a lot of branch closures for several days. We focus on making sure we are prepared for the storms as they're coming and letting our people prepare. We know that the more people prepare, the faster we can respond and get back to work if people are in a good place themselves. So we had a lot of branch closures for several days. We got back up on our feet after Helene. And then you get another one that caused significantly more challenges. Talking to our people in the field, number one, it happened very early in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter. So it gives us plenty of time to respond and recover. I'm sure there will be some customer losses along the coastal -- the immediate coast. But I don't think that's anything too severe that we can't recover from. We've looked at our forecast for October and the future, and there's really nothing there, Ken, that we've seen in the Southeast U.S. that gives us a lot of pause about the fourth quarter, is there? Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer No, not the outlook. Not really impacting the outlook all that much. But the quarter, you look at Southeast, it was probably one of the slower growing regions in the quarter because of the hurricane impact late in the quarter. To the earlier question we had on the call, I do think that if we did not have the impact of that hurricane the last couple of days, we probably would have seen organic growth even stronger coming through as opposed to the 7.7. So it did impact us. But as we think about the outlook, we feel like, as Jerry said, we have enough time here left in this quarter to make up for what we had in October. George Tong -- Analyst Got it. That's helpful. And then as it relates to your growth investments, can you elaborate on what you saw this quarter that prompted you to step up the spend? How would you assess the possibility that growth investments will remain elevated at 3Q levels going forward if market conditions support it? Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer I think the thing that gave us the most hope was the fact that we were seeing 8% organic growth coming through. Leads were strong. Market was very healthy. So we continue to see that, and it's provided Jerry and I and the business leaders, Pat and Stanford, the level of confidence to invest. And it's not that we're investing in every single one of our brands at the same pace, but we did certainly were able to identify certain areas and make more significant investments in certain areas. And so that's really what came through. As far as the outlook and next steps go, yes, we're going to -- we can't say what pace we're going to invest in at this point, but we certainly are going to continue to invest. We firmly believe this is a growth market. This is a growth opportunity. And in order to be most successful, we've got to invest in our people and capturing additional customers. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer And I think part of the algorithm is that you want to acquire customers in the second and third quarter, build your base. Because the phones aren't ringing near as much in the fourth quarter and the first quarter as they do in peak season. So in Q2, Q3 is where you grow your recurring customer base, and that's your bread and butter as you go into the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of 2025, is having a significantly higher customer base in which to serve. And so that makes me very comfortable with the outlook knowing the customer base is healthy and strong. George Tong -- Analyst Very helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aadit Shrestha with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Aadit Shrestha -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to sort of the price. How did price cost spread trend in 3Q '24 versus, let's say, 2Q '24? And on a recurring basis, what sort of margin expansion would you expect from just that spread alone? And would you expect a similar trend in FY '25? Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Hard to say what 2025 will be at this point just yet in terms of margin opportunity and spread. But when you're getting 3% to 4% price increase in this business, you should see margins improve. If I look at the quarter, and I unpacked the quarter, we had 20 basis points of improvement in gross margin. But we invested 30 basis points in our service area. So when you set that aside, you had about 50 basis points of leverage coming through in the quarter in gross margin. It was good to see. And we're hopeful that we'll be able to continue to deliver that pace of improvement going forward. But you know as well as I do that from a quarter-to-quarter basis, things can shift. Aadit Shrestha -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst All right. And just a follow-up. Commercial growth has been pretty strong because of the investments you've been making. And do you see this sort of as high single digits growth -- organic growth in 2025 as well, just because of what you've done already, the sales and sort of ad spend that you've been investing into that business? Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer I think to answer that question, we would look at what we communicated at investor day back in May. And really our plan and our hope is to see commercial business grow at a faster rate than our overall business. You might see resi a little bit slower from time to time, but your overall commercial business should be accretive to the overall organic growth profile of the business as we think about the near term and the investments we're making. Aadit Shrestha -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst All right. Thanks for taking my question. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer You're welcome. Thank you. Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Josh Chan -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, Jerry, Ken and Lyndsey. Thanks for taking my questions. In terms of your decision to hire people at this juncture of the year, could you just talk about the timing? Were you trying to address a little bit of a shortage? Or are you trying to get people time to ramp up for next season? Just maybe unpack the timing of the hiring, that would be great. Thank you. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So I don't -- when you think about from a sales staffing, are you talking more on the sales staffing or the technician front? Josh Chan -- Analyst Yes. It sounds like you invested in both, so would be curious your thoughts on kind of hiring people in the third quarter as opposed to maybe in the spring, something like that. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So if you have the right amount of growth and you have route splits and branch openings and things like that, that were -- and you're trying to maintain the right balance of the number of customers on, say, a service technician's route, things like that, we'll always add. And usually, that's that could occur toward -- more toward the end of season, in the third quarter where we do route splits and things along those lines. And that's the right time to add those customers -- or add those technicians. On the sales side, we have over the last several years taken and hired really year-round and continuing to. What we're cognizant of is one of the things I mentioned, is like how fast can you scale, how fast can you train the right amount. So we're trying to take a balanced approach rather than hiring a bunch of one-time a year, trying to train. Let's say, it's easier to train 20 people in a class that you have four, five classes a year and you're adding 100 than it is to try to add 60 in a quarter and ramp it up and -- because your success rate of hiring 60 versus hiring 20 and putting the time and attention to them in that you need is a little more challenging. So we've taken a more balanced approach to how we onboard and how we time those hires and add strategically over time. And that means we will be making hires throughout the year. I will say generally speaking, though, when we get into the fourth quarter, we do tend to -- especially on home sales inspectors on the residential side, there's a lot less of that hiring. It will usually begin again in the January, February time frame before we head in the season. While on the commercial side, it's a little bit more of a year-round type of event. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer It's interesting you say that and you finish with that, Jerry, because if you just look at the quarter, what we saw was we gained leverage in those areas in September. And so more of our significant -- more significant investments were made in July and August. We didn't see as much investment coming through in September as you did earlier in the third quarter. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer That's a good point, ken, because a lot of that in the quarter was very front-end loaded in the early part of Q3. And then we kind of wind it down, yeah. Josh Chan -- Analyst OK. That makes a lot of sense. I really appreciate the color there. And then on the advertising spending, do you track kind of the returns on advertising? Some returns metric related to advertising spend? And could you talk about whether those metrics have kind of changed over the last, call it, six to 12 months or so? Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. We do measure return on ad spend or roll off. That's a key metric. And that's what makes the -- and particular in the digital channel, so dynamic. where if you look at Q2, when we spent a little less. You're looking at the market, you're looking at the cost to drive the leads in the digital space and you're making adjustments. You may decide to hold off. You may have -- maybe there's some local regional competitors doing some things, and you just say, hey, I'm going to back off for a little while and wait for this to settle down. And then we're going to -- and then you're going to invest a little bit more a little later in the season and into the third quarter where you can drive lower cost of customer acquisition on a better return on your ad spend. So we're always looking at that. And we have been able to manage those costs pretty well to that point too of -- well, again, I know we've said this like a broken record, but we're still going to continue to be disciplined in our advertising spend such that as a percent of revenue, say, on the Orkin brand, they're going to spend as a percent of revenue a very similar amount as a percent of revenue that we have been committed to for years, that amount. So it's a little more in dollars year-to-year as the business grows. But in order to do that, we've got to do -- we've always got to strive to do more with those dollars, acquire customers at a lower cost. So that's a metric that -- return on that spend is a metric that our team is very focused on and makes decisions behind. Josh Chan -- Analyst Thank you for the color and thanks for the time. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Peter Sullivan calling for Stephanie Moore. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hi. Good morning. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Hi, Peter. Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst I was just curious, I know you guys talked a little bit about modernization of SG&A expenses, specifically M&A expenses in 2Q. I'm curious if you could give a little bit more context on how those cost-cutting initiatives are developing and the progress you guys are making. Thanks. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Yeah, we continue to make good progress. When you look at the earnings presentation, you'll see that the administrative side continues to improve. And so as a percentage of sales, we continue to see slight improvements in that area. We're pretty pleased with it in terms of the performance. But we continue to look at ways that we can continue to invest in the modernization of our business. And so -- but overall, we're pretty happy with the returns we've seen on the restructuring dollars we spent a little over a year ago now. Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst Perfect. Thanks, guys. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Thank you. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Davies with Redburn Atlantic. Please proceed with your question. Ollie Davies -- Redburn Atlantic -- Analyst Good morning, guys. Just thinking into next year, and I guess given the investments you've made, would it be fair to assume you'd expect organic growth to kind of accelerate from the 7% to 8% range? Or is it kind of becoming more costly to maintain those above-market growth rates? Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer I'm not sure if it's a question or a comment. But from a standpoint of our organic growth of 7% to 8%, we're pretty happy with that level of growth, especially when you look at the quarter and you're trending closer to 8% as opposed to 7%. I'm pretty happy with the returns we're seeing. I'm not sure that we're ready to sign up for increased growth going into next year. But we're pretty happy with the pace of growth we're seeing in the business. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer And I wouldn't think that achieving those levels of growth should cost us more to drive that growth. I don't see that there's some sort of increase in advertising or selling expense that we would anticipate at this point that would need to be invested in the business in order to maintain those rates. Ollie Davies -- Redburn Atlantic -- Analyst OK. Great. And then just following on, you mentioned the kind of investment eased in the back end of the quarter. I guess, is that true on both the sales and sort of digital advertising side? Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Yes, that is true. What we saw, just looking at the numbers here and checking that. But what we saw is generally across the board, you saw in September more leverage come through the model than what you saw in July and August. And that's the big reason why when we were on our public webcast in mid-September, we talked about the fact that we were investing. We might see more investment come through. A big reason why is because of what we saw in July and August. Ollie Davies -- Redburn Atlantic -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much guys. Kenneth D. Krause -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Thank you. Appreciate your question. Operator Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to the management for closing remarks. Jerry E. Gahlhoff, Jr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

         "If you own Boeing ( BA 3.00% ) stock, you've probably been glued to news of the protracted labor strike by Boeing's machinists union, now entering its fifth week. And you've probably already heard the latest bad news: After two days of renewed talks with union negotiators from the International Association of Machinists (IAM) -- talks that apparently went absolutely nowhere -- Boeing cut off negotiations entirely, withdrew its \"best and final\" offer of a 30% pay raise (spread over four years), and walked away. As Boeing Commercial Aircraft CEO Stephanie Pope explained, \"The union made non-negotiable demands far in excess of what can be accepted if we are to remain competitive as a business.\" In response, IAM complained Boeing \"refused to improve wages, retirement plans and vacation or sick leave,\" according to a report by CNBC. On Thursday, Boeing filed an \"unfair labor practices\" complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing IAM of engaging in not negotiating in good faith. What happens next? Now, presumably, this story doesn't end here. At some point, Boeing must return to the table. It simply cannot afford to leave its 737, 767, and 777 production lines shut down indefinitely. Depending on whom you ask, Boeing is losing anywhere from $1 billion per week (says The Washington Post ) to $1 billion per month (says CNBC) as this strike drags on. Prior guesses have ranged as high as $100 million to $150 million per day (which works out to $3 billion to $4.5 billion per month). Which guess is right? We'll probably not know until Boeing reports its Q3 earnings (which should include results for the first two weeks of the strike). Meanwhile, it's in the union's interests to make Boeing's losses sound as big as possible, to increase pressure on management to agree to its pay hike and pension demands. Conversely, it's in Boeing's interest to make the losses seem as small as believable, to convince workers that it is perfectly content to wait them out. So whichever estimates you hear, make sure to take them with a few grains of salt. That said, here's what we know for sure: According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence , Boeing lost $1.8 billion through the first half of this year. It's actually been losing money for the past six straight years -- since even before the pandemic. Plus, Boeing has nearly $58 billion in debt on its balance sheet, and interest and principal on those debts must be paid whether or not Boeing's building airplanes as the strike stretches on. So however much the strike is costing Boeing, it's adding to the financial strain this company was under well before the strike began. In what appears to be a first, one local Seattle network -- NBC's King 5 affiliate -- suggested on Thursday that this strike could even end in a bankruptcy filing for Boeing. How does Boeing survive this strike? Admittedly, that's a worst-case scenario. Asked about the potential for a bankruptcy filing, though, a Boeing spokesperson merely declined to comment -- which doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Still, it's worth pointing out: Even if this strike lasts five, six, seven weeks, or more, Boeing has options. For example, in a note released Wednesday, investment bank Wells Fargo predicted Boeing will try to sell stock to raise $10 billion to $15 billion to replace money lost to the strike. The company might also simply take out loans to cover its cash needs. Granted, that wouldn't be great for Boeing's credit rating, adding more debt on top of a near-$60 billion debt load already. That's probably one reason S&P put Boeing on notice for a potential downgrade to its credit rating Thursday. Boeing's current rating is \"BBB-,\" which sounds bad, but is still considered investment grade. Now the ratings agency is contemplating cutting Boeing's credit rating to BB -- which sounds better, but is in fact a junk bond rating . But it's still an option. It's also worth remembering that in the much direr straits Boeing faced during the pandemic, when demand for airplanes nearly dried up worldwide, Boeing did both these things. The company took out tens of billions of dollars in loans . And Boeing issued a lot of new stock . In 2020 alone, Boeing issued 20 million shares, and it's issued 33 million more in the years since as it continued losing money. All of which is to say, it's not ideal that Boeing might need to raise a lot of cash, and sell a lot of stock, to survive this strike -- but it's done this before, and it can do it again if it needs to. So ultimately, I don't believe the stock is a bankruptcy risk at this point.",

         "boeing ( ba 3.00% ) stock, probably glued news protracted labor strike boeing's machinist union, entering fifth week. probably already heard latest bad news: two day renewed talk union negotiator international association machinist (iam) -- talk apparently went absolutely nowhere -- boeing cut negotiation entirely, withdrew \"best final\" offer 30% pay raise (spread four years), walked away. boeing commercial aircraft ceo stephanie pope explained, \"the union made non-negotiable demand far excess accepted remain competitive business.\" response, iam complained boeing \"refused improve wages, retirement plan vacation sick leave,\" according report cnbc. thursday, boeing filed \"unfair labor practices\" complaint national labor relation board, accusing iam engaging negotiating good faith. happens next? now, presumably, story end here. point, boeing must return table. simply cannot afford leave 737, 767, 777 production line shut indefinitely. depending ask, boeing losing anywhere $1 billion per week (says washington post ) $1 billion per month (says cnbc) strike drag on. prior guess ranged high $100 million $150 million per day (which work $3 billion $4.5 billion per month). guess right? probably know boeing report q3 earnings (which include result first two week strike). meanwhile, union's interest make boeing's loss sound big possible, increase pressure management agree pay hike pension demands. conversely, boeing's interest make loss seem small believable, convince worker perfectly content wait out. whichever estimate hear, make sure take grain salt. said, here's know sure: according data s&p global market intelligence , boeing lost $1.8 billion first half year. actually losing money past six straight year -- since even pandemic. plus, boeing nearly $58 billion debt balance sheet, interest principal debt must paid whether boeing's building airplane strike stretch on. however much strike costing boeing, adding financial strain company well strike began. appears first, one local seattle network -- nbc's king 5 affiliate -- suggested thursday strike could even end bankruptcy filing boeing. boeing survive strike? admittedly, that's worst-case scenario. asked potential bankruptcy filing, though, boeing spokesperson merely declined comment -- exactly inspire confidence. still, worth pointing out: even strike last five, six, seven weeks, more, boeing options. example, note released wednesday, investment bank well fargo predicted boeing try sell stock raise $10 billion $15 billion replace money lost strike. company might also simply take loan cover cash needs. granted, great boeing's credit rating, adding debt top near-$60 billion debt load already. that's probably one reason s&p put boeing notice potential downgrade credit rating thursday. boeing's current rating \"bbb-,\" sound bad, still considered investment grade. rating agency contemplating cutting boeing's credit rating bb -- sound better, fact junk bond rating . still option. also worth remembering much direr strait boeing faced pandemic, demand airplane nearly dried worldwide, boeing things. company took ten billion dollar loan . boeing issued lot new stock . 2020 alone, boeing issued 20 million shares, issued 33 million year since continued losing money. say, ideal boeing might need raise lot cash, sell lot stock, survive strike -- done before, need to. ultimately, believe stock bankruptcy risk point.",

         "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the hottest investment themes on Wall Street this year, and Nvidia ( NVDA -2.61% ) has become the quintessential AI stock due to its leadership in machine learning processors. But certain Wall Street analysts see a substantial opportunity taking shape around Bitcoin ( BTC 0.46% ) due to the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra at Bernstein believe Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2025, $500,000 by 2029, and $1 million by 2030. That forecast ultimately implies 1,415% upside from its current price of $66,000. Last year, Cathie Wood estimated Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030, but she upped that figure to $3.8 million following approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Her latest forecast implies 5,655% upside from the current price. Several successful hedge fund managers sold shares of Nvidia during the first quarter, while simultaneously buying shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT 6.02% ) , one of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. Ken Griffin at Citadel Advisors sold 2.4 million shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake 68%. Meanwhile, he started a small position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust. David Shaw at D.E. Shaw sold 1.4 million shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 38%. Meanwhile, he started a small position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Israel Englander of Millennium Management sold 720,004 shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 35%. Meanwhile, he started a rather sizable position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust, such that it ranks as his twelfth-largest holding excluding options contracts. The three billionaires mentioned above are noteworthy because they run the three top hedge funds as measured by net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments. Readers should not interpret their trades to mean Nvidia is a bad investment, but rather that diversification has merits. Here's why the iShares Bitcoin Trust is a worthwhile long-term holding for risk-tolerant investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are unlocking demand from institutional investors At any given moment, Bitcoin's price is determined by supply and demand. However, its supply is limited to 21 million coins, so demand is ultimately the driving force behind price action. In other words, demand for Bitcoin would need to increase substantially for its price to reach $1 million, and even more substantially for its price to reach $3.8 million. Bernstein and Ark Invest believe that demand will come from spot Bitcoin ETFs , a brand new asset class approved by the SEC earlier this year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin by holding the cryptocurrency as the underlying asset, and they eliminate traditional sources of friction that may have kept retail and institutional investors out of the market, as detailed below. Spot Bitcoin ETFs let investors add Bitcoin exposure through existing brokerage accounts. That eliminates the complexity of maintaining a separate portfolio with a cryptocurrency exchange. It also simplifies tax reporting because most brokerages link directly to tax preparation software. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are often cheaper. The iShares Bitcoin Trust has an expense ratio of 0.25%, meaning investors will pay $25 per year on every $10,000 in the fund. But Coinbase charges 0.4% to 0.6% per transaction for orders under $10,000, meaning investors get hit with higher fees twice -- once when they buy, and again when they sell. Bernstein and Ark Invest expect Bitcoin to follow different trajectories over the next decade, but they agree on one thing: Demand from institutional investors will drive the forecasted gains. We are still in the early stages of adoption, but institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs is evident in recent Forms 13F filed with the SEC. As mentioned, the top three hedge funds -- Citadel Advisor, D.E. Shaw, and Millennium Management -- have started positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Several major investment banks, including JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley , and Wells Fargo , have also bought into spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, most institutional investors have very small positions at the present time, meaning their stakes represent inconsequential portions of their portfolios. But Bernstein analysts Chhugani and Sapra believe institutional investors are \"in the process of evaluating 'net long' positions as they get comfortable with the improving ETF liquidity.\" Similarly, Cathie Wood at Ark Invest believes institutional investors will eventually put a little more than 5% of their portfolios into spot Bitcoin ETFs. For context, institutions had nearly $120 trillion in assets under management last year, so Ark's forecast implies that those investors will allocate more than $6 trillion to spot Bitcoin ETFs in the future. Should that happen, Wood says the price of Bitcoin could reach $3.8 million. History says Bitcoin will reach a new high between April 2025 and October 2025 Bernstein is also bullish on Bitcoin because of the halving event that took place in April 2024. \"We believe a new cycle commencing with halving is not a coincidence, but driven by unique demand-supply dynamics,\" the analysts wrote in a recent note. To elaborate, Bitcoin block subsidies -- newly minted Bitcoin awarded to miners for solving cryptographic puzzles to verify transaction blocks -- are reduced by 50% every time 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain. Those halving events happen about once every four years, and the most recent one took place in April. That is significant because Bitcoin has gone through three halving events before, and it's price has always reached a new peak 12 to 18 months later, as shown in the chart below. Halving Date Peak Return Time to Peak Return November 2012 10,485% 371 days July 2016 3,103% 525 days May 2020 707% 546 days Source: Fidelity Digital Assets. As shown above, post-halving returns have diminished with each subsequent halving event, simply because each subsequent halving event has a smaller impact on the total supply. But history suggests Bitcoin will peak sometime between April 2025 and October 2025. A word of caution for investors Past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, and price targets should never be taken for granted. Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class, and its limited track record means that forecasting its performance is essentially impossible. Additionally, Bitcoin has declined by more than 50% on several occasions and similar drawdowns are plausible (if not probable) in the future. Investors comfortable with those risks should consider buying a position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust today. Adding exposure to the cryptocurrency is a great way to diversify a portfolio overloaded with AI stocks like Nvidia.",

         "Chevron ( CVX 2.81% ) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Nov 01, 2024 , 11:00 a.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Good morning. My name is Justin, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's third-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the head of investor relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead. Jake Spiering -- General Manager, Investor Relations Thank you, Justin. Welcome to Chevron's third-quarter 2024 earnings conference call and webcast. I'm Jake Spiering, head of investor relations. Our chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Eimear Bonner are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now, I will turn it over to Mike. Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer All right. Thanks, Jake. This quarter, Chevron delivered strong financial and operational results, returned record cash to shareholders, and achieved project milestones that are expected to deliver production and cash flow growth over the coming years. We continue to see strong performance in the Permian and executed major turnarounds at TCO and Gorgon ahead of schedule. Worldwide production increased by 7% from the prior year and set a third-quarter record. We started up the high-pressure Anchor project and began water injection to boost production at the Jack/St. Malo and Tahiti fields. These projects combined with additional project start-ups through 2025 are expected to grow Gulf of Mexico production to 300,000 barrels per day by 2026. We've expanded our CO2 storage portfolio adding over 2 million acres offshore Western Australia. In September, the FTC completed its review of the company's merger with Hess. And we also recently announced several asset sales as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization efforts. This quarter marked the one-year anniversary of the PDC Energy acquisition. We've successfully combined the two companies, taking best practices from both and applying them across our shale and tight portfolio. We've exceeded our guidance of $500 million in combined capital and cost synergies by more than 30% and have delivered more than $1 billion in incremental free cash flow since acquiring PDC. Chevron's well performance is 40% better than the DJ Basin average and we continue to optimize development plans. We have advantaged inventory with around 75% locations at a breakeven below $50 per barrel. We expect to hold production at a plateau around 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day through the end of the decade. Our operations in Colorado are among the lowest carbon intensity assets in the industry, benefiting from tankless production facilities that lower greenhouse gas emissions by 90% compared to older designs. Where possible, we utilize grid-powered rigs that reduce more than 60% of our on-site greenhouse gas emissions from drilling. At TCO, the team continues to deliver consistent progress on project milestones. All four pressure boost facilities are now online and operating with high reliability. All production is flowing through these facilities, which allows optimization of existing plants and enabled the highest daily production in the field's 31 years of service. Remaining metering stations are all under conversion and we're confident in the incremental well capacity that will feed FGP. We've initiated final lead testing for the wet sour gas compressors and are preparing the crude processing systems for operation. Complex commissioning activities will continue over the coming months, leading into initial start-up activities in the first quarter of 2025. We continue to divest non-core positions at significant value. We've announced asset sales in Canada, Alaska, and Congo that will contribute before tax proceeds of approximately $8 billion. Pending regulatory approvals, we expect to close these transactions in the fourth quarter. In Canada, we've received a compelling offer for our Kaybob Duvernay shale position and non-operated interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands project. Both are good assets and we have a long history there, but they are a better fit for a reputable counterparty at an attractive deal value for Chevron. Now I'll turn it over to Eimear to discuss the financials. Eimear Bonner -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Mike. We've reported third-quarter earnings of $4.5 billion or $2.48 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.5 billion or $2.51 per share. Organic capex was $4 billion for the quarter, in line with our budget. Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry, ending the quarter with a net debt ratio under 12%. Cash flow in the third quarter was the highest for the year, despite lower oil prices. Working capital decreased by $1.4 billion on lower inventory levels. Share repurchases were a record $4.7 billion at the top end of our quarterly guidance range. Our financial priorities are unchanged and we plan to use our strong balance sheet to reward shareholders consistently through commodity cycles. Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down about $150 million. Adjusted upstream earnings were down mainly due to lower liquids realizations and high DD&A at TCO and partly offset by higher listings. Adjusted Downstream earnings increased primarily due to favorable timing effects and higher U.S. volumes. This was partially offset by lower U.S. refining margins. Adjusted third-quarter earnings were down $1.2 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted upstream earnings were flat. Lower liquids realizations and higher DD&A were mostly offset by higher liftings and timing effects. Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased mainly due to lower refining margins. All Other was down primarily due to interest expense. Third-quarter oil equivalent production was up around 70,000 barrels per day from last quarter. Strong production in the Permian primarily in our company-operated New Mexico assets was the main driver. We expect full-year average production growth to finish at the top end of our guidance range of 4% to 7%. Costs always matter in the commodity business. We have a track record of managing unit costs, well below inflation while successfully integrating several acquisitions. Higher returns require competitive costs and safe and reliable operations. Executing turnarounds on budget and on schedule is a key performance driver, and we've delivered outstanding performance in 2024. Our teams have collaborated across upstream and downstream to standardize the approach to these complex maintenance events, increasing the days our facilities are online and lowering unit costs. While we anticipate significant volume growth in the years ahead, we also expect to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. These cost savings will largely come from optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed including the expanded use of global capability centers. Now looking ahead. In the fourth quarter, Upstream will have downtime, which is expected to be split between U.S. and international operations. Impacts to production from divestments are expected to be around 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter. Downstream will have higher planned maintenance primarily at El Segundo and Pascagoula. We will also have a shutdown at the Pascagoula Refinery enabling the light tight oil expansion to come online. We anticipate affiliate dividends to be around $1 billion this quarter. Share repurchases are expected to be between $4 billion and $4.75 billion in the fourth quarter, unchanged from prior guidance. Proceeds from asset sales are expected to be about $8 billion before taxes in the quarter. Back to you, Jake. Jake Spiering -- General Manager, Investor Relations That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. [Operator instructions] We'll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Justin, please open the lines. Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bank of America. Jean Salisbury -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. The main feedback I have heard from investors hesitant on Chevron is wanting resolution on TCO start-up and Hess. At what point should investors consider TCO start-up largely derisked? Is there like a specific milestone in the commissioning and start-up process like where you've listed here where you could say, OK, start-up probably really can't slip much from here and are we there now? Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So thanks for the question. We are making really great progress. And I think you saw that again this quarter, as we've had several quarters now, where we've laid out expected milestones and delivered on them. The team is delivering predictable commissioning and start-up activity. And I ran through some of the current state relative to low-pressure production, strongest day of production ever, etc. That said, there is still significant complex commissioning work still ahead, particularly on the future growth project. That work is well underway here, and we expect, as we said, to begin start-up procedures in the first quarter. So our cost and schedule guidance is unchanged. One of the key things for us and this is a learning, from other projects over the years is, to ensure reliability, we want to make sure that we have everything ready to start-up safely and then run reliably as we go forward. And so, we're going to continue to be very methodical in the way we go about starting up the equipment there. But it is, every quarter that passes it's being derisked. I don't know that there's a magic threshold, where you can say it's entirely derisked. But everything we say or everything we see is very positive. In fact, Eimear was there just recently along with Mark Nelson. Maybe Eimear, you can share some of the things you saw at TCO. Eimear Bonner -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Mike. And yes, it was great to be back and to be with Mark and Jake and the team in Tengiz. And when we were there, they actually achieved a key milestone the day we arrived in Tengiz and that was when they fully transitioned to feeding all of the existing six production trains with low-pressure production fed through the pressure boost facility. So I think the fact that the production was at high levels producing through the pressure boost facility just showed the high reliability that's been achieved there. We also visited three sites at Tengiz. Jinan, the first one was the operations and control center and there we saw how they're leveraging the advanced process control technology, digital tools to really optimize production, keep the plants full and plan work safely. So that was great to see that, that's been part of the project and is really enabling a whole new level of optimization. We went to the sites that Mike talked about where the complex commissioning is ongoing, so the 3GP site, the third generation site, and there's large and high number of equipment that's being commissioned there. So we talked to the team about how diligent they're being to ensure that, we do the performance testing on the equipment, we commission the equipment, and we do that in a very methodical way. So that was great to see. We also went to the third-generation injection facility. And with the design that we have, we will be injecting all of the produced gas into the reservoir to help with pressure management and they were doing injection testing when we were there. That's a key bit of derisking to know that the wells will take the sour gas into the back end of the reservoir. Overall, it was a great visit. We came away really encouraged by the work of the team, by the consistent progress that's being achieved, but also by just the rigorous planning and thought that's going into ensuring a safe and reliable start-up and ramp-up over the first-half 2025. Thanks for the question, Jean Ann. Operator Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta -- Analyst Good morning, Mike and team. I just wanted to spend some time on the Permian. You had indicated in the prepared remarks that you expect to finish toward the top end of the 4% to 7% range in guidance and you highlighted strength in company-operated New Mexico. Can you spend a little bit more time unpacking that, the sustainability of that? And just how should we think about the path to ultimately getting to plateau at this asset? Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Neil, we did have a nice strong quarter again in the Permian. I realized a lot of our activity now being in New Mexico, the data is not quite as timely and transparent maybe as in on the Texas side. So you may not see that. But a couple of things. Number one, our new well performance has been very, very strong in the Delaware Basin. We've got a lot of that in the third quarter in particular, we're in the second Bone Spring and seeing top-quartile performance out of those wells. Also in the -- on the Texas side in the Delaware and the Wolfcamp A, were outperforming expectations. So new wells and the completion of pop time on those new wells has been very, very strong. In the base business, we're seeing stronger reliability performance, proactive maintenance efforts are paying off. We're seeing artificial lift optimization now, sustaining strong production. And we're seeing efficiency gains in everything from completions designs, coordination, and logistics to reduce mobilization. We've talked about triple frac before. And so, across the entire activity portfolio in the basin, we just continue to see improvement in the execution of that and then improvement in the performance of the wells. As we move toward the 1 million barrel-a-day mark next year, we will begin to shape our profile there a little bit toward a plateau. And we really begin to focus on free cash flow. And so, growth will become less the driver and free cash flow will become more of the driver if you will. So we'll bring capital spending down. And I think what you'll see is this year is probably going to be the peak in Permian capex. As we move forward, we'll start to attenuate that. The growth, which has been at a 15% CAGR for the last three years probably going to be higher than that this year, will begin to attenuate as well and will really open up the free cash flow there. So more to follow in terms of exactly what that looks like. I'm sure people are curious about that. So we'll provide more guidance here over the next call or two, so you can start to think of what that looks like. But the headline here is continued efficiency and productivity gains, strong free cash flow today, and we're going to manage it for even stronger free cash flow in the future. Operator The next question will come from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research. Doug Leggate -- Analyst Good morning. Sorry, I had a frog in my throat. Mike, I appreciate the opportunity to ask your question. If I could observe, as a kind of precursor to my question, this is probably your best operating quarter in quite a while, so congrats to share prices responding accordingly. But, if you look at your relative underperformance, since you announced the Hess deal. It's clearly a huge weight of uncertainty on the stocks, basically wiped out the value of Hess. So it is a Hess question. And it goes something like this. You've now got FTC since we last spoke on the last call. You've got the shareholder vote, and you're moving ahead with, I guess, what many would think with the post-Hess acquisitions disposals. The synergies presumably are not related to Guyana, why not go ahead and close the deal if you're so confident in your legal position? Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Look, the relative performance of the shares relates to a lot of things number one. And so, I wouldn't dispute the fact that the Hess uncertainty is a material contributor. But as you said, we've had some performance unevenness that we've -- I think we've ironed out and we need to prove that. But, we announced the cost and schedule update to TCO during this period of time. So there's been a number of things that I think are all part of that. All of which are a high priority and as you see today are getting a lot of attention and I think improving. Look, we've got a deal structure with Hess that has a condition precedent that, if there's an arbitration the arbitration has to be concluded. We are confident that, it will be successfully concluded, but that's the way we set the deal up and we're going to execute the transaction the way the transaction is written and integration planning is going very well. We're working very closely on everything that we can at this point in the process to prepare for the future. And I realize that, the timing on this is unfortunate, but we're continuing to move forward and look forward to integrating the two companies and being really the premier oil and gas company prepared for the energy transition. Thanks, Doug. Operator Our next question will come from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria -- Analyst Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask around the Canada sales. If I go back to the Hess deal, the rationale was to buy long cycle, high-quality resource, and obviously helps diversify your portfolio. Guyana is very different to Canada obviously. But could you just talk about the decision to execute that divestment, one, now ahead of the arbitration decision, which was a surprise, but also more broadly, I would have thought you were a net buyer of kind of long cycle resource. So if you could just talk about how you're thinking about that and how you're thinking about the portfolio that would be helpful. Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Biraj, we've got a long history in Canada. It's been a good business. AOSP has been a steady contributor of cash for many years. But, we've also indicated that, as a 20% non-op position, it wasn't really viewed as a core asset in the portfolio. So as we were marketing the unconventional position in the Kaybob Duvernay, we were not actually marketing AOSP, but the buyer came to us and proposed buying both, and made us a very attractive offer to buy both. The Duvernay, while it's a good asset, was struggling to compete against the strength in other parts of our shale and tight portfolio. And AOSP, as we've indicated for some time, is a non-core asset. We were willing to consider offers for it, but there was a long time when I think potential buyers were struggling to give us the value that we saw to your point for a long-duration asset. The Canadian producers are faring better today. I think their equity valuations have recovered. And so, we were presented with an opportunity to transact at what we thought was good value and we've been patient. Others have left the oil sands over the years at what we felt were discounted values and we weren't prepared to do that. But when we got a value that we thought was a fair value, we were prepared to transact. And, yes, we want to add good-quality, long-duration assets to the portfolio, but we have a lot of those in our portfolio today. And so, I don't think you should read our desire for those kinds of assets to say that anything that would kind of broadly fit under that heading is not eligible for potential divestment. We're going to continue to high grade our portfolio over time. And we add quality assets and use technology to improve the value of assets in our portfolio, we'll always ask ourselves, if kind of the balance of the portfolio has more value to others than it does to us and be willing to entertain that kind of question. Thanks, Biraj. Operator And the next question will come from Josh Silverstein with UBS. Josh Silverstein -- Analyst Thanks, guys. Just on the $2 billion to $3 billion cost savings, how much of this comes from the announced $8 billion of asset sales year to date versus what maybe comes from additional asset sales and structural cost savings? And then any split between upstream or downstream? Eimear Bonner -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Josh. Let me talk you through kind of our plan here, given that it's some new material. First of all, as you saw on the slide, we've been disciplined in managing our cost competitively over the years. This program is essentially our next set of cost-reduction steps to sustain our discipline, given that in our business, costs are always matter. They're always important. What we're focused on here is, reducing absolute costs while we deliver significant growth in the business. Think about this program as focused on the controllable, and we're expecting run rate reductions to be realized over the next few years by the end of 2026 from a 2024 baseline. The full benefits will be seen in 2027. In terms of where the reduction is coming from, the first category is really portfolio actions. Examples, like what we've heard today in the call on the United Canada, Alaska, Congo sales. There's a large portion of this is associated with that. We see the direct costs be reduced as the asset transfer from our portfolio and then we would expect overhead costs associated with those assets to reduce over time. That's one part of this program. The second part is just improvement initiatives, and these are initiatives that we see across the organization. They're coming from the business units, all segments, they're coming from the functions. Some examples of what we're talking about here is, initiatives that leverage technology solutions to reduce cost and drones, robotics, digital twins that have transformed how we think about operating and maintaining our facilities and that would be an example. Another example would be improvement initiatives that really look to how we do our work, where we do our work? An example there would be the recent announcement of the ENGINE and global capability center in India. So in these centers, we're looking to standardize and centralize more of our workflow. So that's really what the program is. When you think about the range, what I'd say is, the first $2 billion think about these as divestments and cost reduction and cost reduction initiatives that are in our plan. They're firm. They're either execution ready or working toward becoming execution ready. Think about the third billion as additional target that we have with initiatives that are underway that we haven't fully quantified. They're not execution ready. We have work to do to make them execution ready. That's how I would describe the range and we expect to provide updates on these initiatives. We'll do that through 2025 as we execute on them and we deliver results. Thanks. Operator We'll go to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet and shareholder returns. Your net debt ticked up a bit quarter over quarter in 3Q versus 2Q, I think you support strong buybacks. And you're still well below your long-term targets. You have cash coming in the door from asset sale proceeds, as you noted, between now and year-end, and then nice inflection in the Permian and TCO cash flow into next year. But I guess my question is, given Permian and TCO cash flow into next year. But I guess my question is given how volatile commodity markets and oil markets specifically have been in recent times, how do you think about continuing to use the balance sheet to support shareholder returns versus tapering it back and waiting for potentially lower commodity prices over the next few years? So balance sheet use and how you think about that is the core of the question. Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Devin, let me just address share repurchases and then I'll let Eimear talk about the balance sheet. Recent volatility in commodity prices to somebody who's been in this industry for 42 years is not new news. That is the way this industry works and we're in a volatile cyclical commodity business. So the backdrop is nothing we're not well-prepared for. First thing is, I just want to reiterate our guidance. The share repurchase run rate of $17.5 billion is unchanged. The range we've given you kind of brackets the way we execute the program and we were a little bit above the midpoint of that here this most recent quarter. We got a strong track record of buying back shares which is our fourth financial priority and that's after making sure we can sustain and increase the dividend or we've got a track record of doing that for 37 years in a row, reinvesting in organic projects to grow future cash flows to support that, so the second priority. The third is to maintain a strong balance sheet. We've got AA credit and below 12% net debt. And then, the fourth is to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases which we've done for 2017 in the last 21 years. And so consistency in financial priorities, consistency in execution is very important. And I think we've got a track record that we can stand behind there through commodity price cycles. Over the last 20, 21 years where I said '17 to '21 that we've repurchased, we've seen a financial crisis. We've seen a pandemic. We've seen OPEC open-up the taps and commodity prices respond accordingly. And so, we've been through down cycles. We've been through unexpected circumstances and have maintained the strong track record of shareholder distributions through it, in part, because we've maintained a conservative financial position and a very strong balance sheet. I'll let Eimear talk a little bit more about the balance sheet. Eimear Bonner -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Devin, when we look at the balance sheet, we're focused on maintaining its strength through the cycles, right? It's an asset that we use to create value and to navigate the volatility that Mike talked about and reward shareholders consistently. So when we look at our debt levels today, our net debt under 12%. That's at the low end of where we've been over the last 10-plus years. So we're underlevered and given this and all the growth that's coming and the additional asset sale proceeds that we're expecting in the short-term. We're comfortable with where we are, and we anticipate the net debt will come down a little bit in the near-term with the asset sale proceeds that are coming. But we're planning with a multiyear time horizon with a through-cycle approach. And, we're very comfortable with where we are right now with the balance sheet. Thanks. Operator And moving on to Lloyd Byrne with Jefferies. Lloyd Byrne -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. First, congrats to you and your M&A team, I think the divestiture progress has been great. I want to follow up quickly to Biraj's question, AOSP seemed very opportunistic. Does that change your long-term goals? And then really, I wanted to ask about the DJ and see whether -- I mean, it's just really impressive operating progress there synergies, free cash flow. But I think the surprise has to be you guys holding it flat to the end of the decade. Maybe you can just comment on the opportunities there and whether there's more opportunities for scale. Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So just to quickly touch on AOSP. There was one kind of most logical buyer, right? And it was the operator, and we've had discussions over the years. And have not been able to really get to a common view on value. And so that's what's changed. And so if you want to say that's opportunistic, that's fine. But we really wanted to realize the value that we saw in that asset, and we've been able to do that. The DJ, look, the first thing I'll say is the integration there and the synergy delivery continues the track record that we've had over a long time of exceeding our synergy commitments. And when we do a deal and we come out with a target, it's intended to give you a high confidence number that you can use. And we've done the diligence we have at that point. And our track record is we find more and we deliver more. We're very happy with the quality of the assets and the ability to drive strong performance. We've learned from each of the companies that we've acquired. I talked a little bit about the lower carbon footprint there. We've seen some other things like gas lift and new laterals that have been used by some of these companies that we're starting to work with in some of our other parts of our portfolio. And the last thing I'll say is the team there does a wonderful job of balancing this multistep permitting process. And I know there's been some concern expressed by people about the regulatory environment. We're working very closely with the regulator in Colorado to ensure that we can achieve their objectives and that we can achieve our objectives. And I'd say that's a very constructive relationship. We've got comprehensive area plans in place that derisk the longer-term development and the quality of the asset, 400,000 barrels a day out through the end of the decade. Three years ago, we had zero in the DJ Basin. And so very pleased with it. We're big there. We're the biggest operator there. If the question was are you going to acquire some additional positions there? I wouldn't say that's high on the priority list. The real key is to drive value out of this asset. Operator And the next question will come from Betty Jiang with Barclays. Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Betty. Operator Betty, your line is open, perhaps you were just on mute. Betty Jiang -- Analyst I was on mute, I'm sorry. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I want to ask about Gulf of Mexico. Feels like there is a bit of technology renaissance that's happening in GA and including Anchor project that just came online. Can you talk about how the technology is opening up new resource opportunities for Congo for the Chevron portfolio? And does that represent any upside to how you think about the longer-term production and resource opportunities in that area? Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Betty, it sure does. And it's an extension of the story of the Gulf of Mexico. Initially, on the shelf as people move from onshore to offshore, then out into the deepwater, and we began to develop techniques to explore and ultimately develop and produce in deepwater, now in the ultra-deepwater. And in the ultra-deepwater now at ultra-high pressures and temperatures. And the breakthroughs on the Anchor project, and it's the first one to be producing with 20,000 psi technology. I mentioned last week and something I was doing just to help people understand that. That's essentially the pressure that would exist if an elephant, a full-grown male African elephant were standing on a quarter. And so it's incredibly high pressure. This is a high-temperature fields that the -- everything that goes along with that needs to be capable of dealing with those pressures. That includes trees, blowout preventers, etc. We have a 3 million-ton hook load now on the drillships, which is the highest hook load we've ever seen. That opens up a lot, at least 20% of our exploration portfolio is going to require this kind of capability. We're using other things like ocean bottom nodes, seismic now that helps us better characterize developments and exploration opportunities. Think of it as 4D essentially, technology out there. We're working on AI tools to help guide exploration focus areas and predict geologic risk factors more effectively. So yes, the -- I think the history of the Gulf of Mexico has been technology advancements to continue to allow us to identify and then produce resource out there. It's a vast area. The Mississippi River is and was an incredible conveyor belt for organic material out into the Gulf of Mexico over geologic times. And the industry isn't done there by any means. I think there's a lot left to go. And maybe the last thing I'll say about it is this is about unlocking new opportunities. We're also working hard to make better use of existing infrastructure with near field development. The ability to tie back at longer distances and develop smaller discoveries that wouldn't support a stand-alone greenfield developments, but can very easily tie back as a brownfield to an existing facility. Ballymore is a good example of this, and I think you're going to see more of those as well. So the heyday, the Gulf of Mexico is far, far from over. Operator And the next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng -- Analyst Hi. Good morning Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Paul Paul Cheng -- Analyst Good morning. You have an excellent production record in both the Tengiz and Gorgon that they have done well. And there's particularly impressive that given both of them, you have turned around not like the turnaround has done well and maybe they're coming in faster than the scheduled time. So is it a one-off or that you have changed the process so that this is a repeatable benefit that we could expand in the future. Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul, it's the latter. And we've been working this both upstream and downstream because these facilities are starting to look a lot more similar than they are different. And to deliver higher returns, one of the keys is to execute turnaround as well, ensure the work that's done enables reliable operations in between turnarounds and to continually improve on this. I mentioned earlier that Eimear was just out in Kazakhstan and has been at Gorgon, not too much earlier. Eimear, maybe you can talk a little bit more specifically about what you're seeing on turnaround execution. Eimear Bonner -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, no problem. And thanks, Paul, for the question. Yes, to Mike's point, I mean, our complex facilities, whether they're in refining or upstream assets like TCO and Gorgon, they're more similar than different. And so this has been an area of focus for us to try and standardize how we approach these complex turnarounds to really drive performance. So we've been working on it diligently for a few years. And I think the improvement actions that I would point to would include maybe the first one is just how we think about the scope of the turnaround. And think about this as looking at all the units and equipment and discerning, can I do the maintenance work on the run or do I need to do the maintenance work only when the plant is shut down. And so there's a lot of improvement being delivered because we've been very diligent about discerning what's in and what's out. We call out rigorous scope management. The second improvement talks to the digital tools that we've used to really help with not only planning but execution and prioritization. I'll give you a couple of examples of the digital tools. Digital tools that help us with permits, digital tools that help us with isolation, digital tools help us with leak testing and flange management in addition to digital tools that help us with managing the span and control given that these turnarounds bring in huge numbers of personnel at once. That's another area. The third one, which I believe we've taken a whole different level as benchmarking and we benchmark turnarounds. We benchmark the units. But the benchmarking that we're doing today, the benchmarking goes down to the equipment level. And so just the rigor in the benchmarking to look for improvements and to learn where we can be more efficient is yielding positive results. Then finally, I would say, we have experts in this capability perspective. We have employees that have spent most of their careers in turnarounds, they're masters in turnarounds. And so we have looked for opportunities to share resources and to cross point with these experts so that the lessons that we learned in TCO, we can learn them in Gorgon and vice versa. The lessons that we're learning in refining we can implement those lessons learned in the upstream. So all of those things coming together has really driven a step change in our performance with nearly 9 turnarounds executed this year, almost all of them have been delivered at industry level performance. So we're very pleased of this work given the criticality of it to be as business excellence. And we're -- these results are industry-leading. Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Paul, eight out of the nine turnarounds were executed in line with first quartile duration targets. The Gorgon Train 2 turnaround was our best Gorgon turnaround ever with a 14% improvement in duration. The TCO KTL-1 turnaround was a 23% improvement in duration compared to the last one. And in several of our refinery turnarounds saw cost decreases of up to 50% compared to the prior turnaround of that unit. So I think there's some real quantifiable progress that you can see across the system that's being achieved. Thanks, Paul. Operator And the next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett -- Analyst Good morning. If I return to the structural cost reductions, and I want to put it in the context of the relocation from California to Texas. Is that relocation an opportunity to the cost reductions, I believe that redesign processes and organizations? Or is it a threat to the cost reductions, right? There's chaos and lack of continuity. How do you think about that? Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I don't think it's a threat, Bob. We're going to -- we've talked about the relocation occurring over a period of time. We're going to be very thoughtful about moving work from one location to another, moving people from one location to another. Not all of the work that's being done in San Ramon necessarily will go to Houston. So it may go to these global capability centers that Eimear has talked about earlier. Some of it, we may find technology tools that help us to do the work more efficiently and automate things. And so I think it's a little bit of a simplistic reduction to think about just lifting and shifting everything from San Ramon to Houston. It's a migration of work to for technology platforms, different locations. And we'll do that thoughtfully and methodically over a period of time. We'll make sure it's been planned out and any risk. And so I think it's part of an ongoing work evolution in a global company that has a workforce around the world that can do work in many different places that historically did a lot of work in business units because that's the way it had to be done. But now there's other ways to approach this work, and we're looking for ways to do it best to deliver the best work product and do that at a cost structure that's ever improving. Thanks for the question. Operator And moving on to Lucas Herrmann with BNP Paribas. Lucas Herrmann -- Analyst Yeah. Thanks very much and afternoon. Mike, Fairly obvious question, I guess. I just wanted to talk to you. I wondered if both of you could talk a little bit more about capex going forward. And maybe it's an inappropriate time and December will be better. But if I look at what's happening with the business, obviously, Tengiz starts up. You've got your assets in the Gorgon coming on. You're talking about driving free cash flow driving for NPV value in the Permian capex coming down there. If I think about the current rate of capex spend, including associates deals -- it's around $18 billion, $18.5 billion if you guided at the beginning of the year. If I look at the opportunities for that capex to start to fall these projects or production plateaus or projects come on, it feels as though maybe $3 billion, $4 billion of capex opportunities, so it's the opportunities to support capex decline [Inaudible]. What's really hard, Mike, Eimear, is to see where that goes, particularly given, obviously, everything going on in the East Med at the moment. So is it right now to start thinking about capex coming down very materially as we move forward over the next two, three years and you're really starting to benefit emphatically from a portfolio but in essence, is deep in resource, but pretty long duration. Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So you've covered a lot of waterfront there, Lucas. Let me try to address it and then let Eimear share some of her thoughts. Number one, I think an important point is if you look at the ratability of our capex, we used to have a program that had a lot of big long-duration capital projects. There was a pattern over the back half of the year, fourth quarter, in particular, tended to be a little bit heavier. First quarter, a little bit lighter. We're very ratable now. We've been about $4 billion on our organic capex all three quarters this year. So it's become much more ratable and predictable. That's a reflection of the nature of the projects that we're doing. Point two, you talked about capex coming down. A decade ago, our capex was $40 billion. Today, it's in affiliates, as you say, it's 18-something, $18.5 billion or whatever that number is. So it's less than half of where we were. So it's come down substantially even as production has grown as the company generates more cash. We're doing it in a much more capital-efficient manner than we ever have before. And point three is, yes, we will continue to seek further ways to optimize and improve the capital efficiency of our company. A larger portfolio does, over time, require capital to maintain it. And so there analyze the trade-offs that you evaluate as you look at your capital investment opportunities, the readiness of those to move into execution. And I think in the near-term, what's very clear is our affiliate capex will come down next year as the project in Kazakhstan concludes. So you'll see affiliate capex come off. We're in the process right now of finalizing our business plan for 2025. And so it is a bit premature for me to guide you to that number. But we're looking at all the trade-offs and then we'll talk more about that after we complete our planning process. But our intent is to stay very disciplined, which I think is something we've demonstrated here over many, many years now. Our guidance range of $14 billion to $16 billion is unchanged. And I think you should expect us to respect that. And if that does change by some quantum, and you throw out some larger numbers there, we'll cover that with everybody and talk about how it's changed, why it's changed and how you should think about what that means going forward. Eimear, do you want to add anything to that? Eimear Bonner -- Chief Financial Officer I think you've covered most of it, Mike, given that we're putting our plan together right now. Lucas, all I'd say is the projects that you referenced and how we see the capex profile is coming off and the free cash flow growing as those projects complete, it's a key focus for us. So we'll give you more information on a fourth-quarter call as we complete the process, we don't want to get ahead of the process right now. Thanks for the question. Operator And the next question will come from John Royall with J.P. Morgan. John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So could you talk about your position in California in the downstream, still having two refineries there, and we've had another closure announced over the past couple of weeks, is shutting capacity something you've considered in California? And how do you think the market will be impacted by this latest closure? Do you think we'll see structurally higher profitability there as a result or maybe things will adapt kind of back to where they were? Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, John. First of all, I think what I would say is we've seen another ill-conceived move by a state that has implemented policies to deliver its residents, the highest gasoline prices in the country. This most recent action to insert state bureaucracy into turnaround planning and inventory management is likely is to make prices go higher, not go lower. Putting bureaucrats in charge of centrally planning key segments of the economy hasn't worked in other social states, and I doubt it will be any different in California. Policies that constrained supply faster than demand is adjusting create more volatility, and they tend to create a greater likelihood of higher prices. And so, unfortunately, these measures are advertised as doing the opposite. But the reality is for anybody that looks at them and think them through discouraging investment and constraining supply when you still have strong demand is going to lead to just one conclusion. And so look, we've operated in California for over a century both of our refineries are over 100 years old. We've got -- they're very competitive refineries, and we've got strong integrated value chains with very strong brands, strong customer relationships. And so these are competitive businesses that we will continue to evaluate within our portfolio like every other asset, as we've discussed earlier. And so we will continue to meet our customer needs and compete. We'll evaluate alternatives if and when it becomes evident that that's the appropriate thing to do. But I'll tell you, it's very tough to justify any new investments in that system, and it's only getting tougher. Thanks for the question. Operator And we'll take a question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read -- Analyst Yeah. Thank you. Good morning Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Roger. Roger Read -- Analyst I'd like to ask you, Mike, the LNG markets globally, we've seen some new units get delayed. We've seen a couple of other companies this earnings season talk about the outlook in terms of supply/demand balance kind of favoring tightness in '25. Just curious how you look at it and maybe if you could remind us your contract versus spot exposure so we could think about how that might play to the margin potential for Chevron in '25. Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So LNG demand continues to grow, but it comes against a backdrop of very healthy inventories. You asked about two Inventories in Europe are strong for this time of year. Inventories in the U.S. are very healthy for this time of the year. You see that reflected in Henry Hub prices. And so overall, we've got a market that currently has healthy inventories and reasonably good supply becomes somewhat weather dependent. And so that can change with a very cold winter. But right now, I would say it doesn't look like 2025 is setting up to be a particularly tight market. And then longer term, of course, we have supply coming on in Qatar. We've got supply coming on in the U.S. And so there's more supply coming to that market. And so I think in the short to medium term, it's a market that is not really prone to becoming nearly as tight as what we saw a couple of years ago when the situation in Ukraine began. Our particular portfolio is 80-plus percent contracted primarily on oil-indexed pricing on long-term contracts. Most of our sales are into North Asia and 20% or less spot exposure and a lot of that is out of our West Africa position and we'll have some spot cargoes from other parts of the system occasionally. But primarily long-term contracts primarily tied to crude price. Thanks, Roger. Operator And moving on to Nitin Kumar with Mizuho. Nitin Kumar -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, I wanted to just maybe touch a little bit on the chemicals business. It seemed like it was a bit of a tailwind to earnings this quarter. What are you seeing from your supply chain, particularly in Asia? You've heard about some stimulus to be offered there, but just looking at what the earnings look like for the chemist business. Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. We actually polyethylene chain margins have strengthened over the course of this year. So it's been an improving market backdrop. Some of that, I think, has been some short-term supply disruptions in certain areas. These are long-cycle commodity markets that demand grows kind of steadily but slowly supply comes on in big chunks. And so we've had a market that's been a little bit oversupplied, and that's put pressure on the olefin chains, particularly in Asia. And so I think over time, we expect to see margins improve. We've got a couple of projects that will come online in the second half of this decade. And you can't time these things perfectly. But I think they're likely to come on after the trough and into what's an improving olefin chain market, one of those projects in the U.S., one in the Middle East. Asia is the big market, obviously. Naphtha and naphtha cracking being the alternative. You do have some interrelation on margins with crude oil prices and if at the margin, Asia naphtha crackers or what an ethane cracker in the Middle East or the U.S. is competing with, you've got some interplay between those two. And so we'll watch it over time. CPChem is a well-run business, GS Caltex in Korea is a well-run business, and we've seen these kinds of cycles before. We remain very constructive on this sector over time as we think the fundamentals will be very good and CPChem in particular, has a lot of ethane-based feedstock, which makes it very competitive. Thanks, Nitin. Operator And moving on to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Maybe just maybe one on the Eastern Mediterranean. Can you maybe just provide a status update in terms of the current operations, the Tamar expansion efforts it's the next leg of potential expansion of commercial development there and what impact I guess, what is and is not happening or moving forward given the current uncertainties in the region right now? Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So obviously, the first priority is the safety and well-being of our employees and the integrity assets. We have seen the demobilization of the pipelay vessel that was working on the current expansion projects at both Tamar and Leviathan as the contractor concluded that the risk environment was one that they were not comfortable with. We see both of those projects still being completed late next year. We'll keep you advised. Obviously, this will depend on when that is remobilized. But we've got projects underway in the short term at both Leviathan to increase production by about 200 million cubic feet a day to 1.4 Bcf. And tomorrow is about 0.5 billion cubic feet per day from 1.1 to 1.6. So those are on-track for late next year. We've entered feed for a larger expansion at Leviathan that would take us up significantly more. There's some room on the platform to add more processing capacity. That's a project that would be completed toward the end of this decade, and we're in feed on that now. So more to follow. I think in the short term, obviously, we're going to make sure people are safe. We've had to actually take production at Leviathan down a couple of times because some of the risks in the region. But we're meeting all of our supply commitments, both in the country and to regional customers. And been able to do that despite the conflict that's been underway. Operator And our last question comes from Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme -- Analyst Hi, Mike. And Mike, you talked earlier to the operated Permian position. I just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing in the non-ARP royalty piece. Are we seeing a two-speed operating system in the basin with respect to what various operators are doing? Michael K. Wirth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. We've seen strength across all three of the components of our business. Our club growth this year, as I said, is probably going to be a little bit higher than the 15% we've seen in the last three years. Royalty may be a little lower than that, JV a little bit higher. I don't know -- I think you said do we see a two-speed development approach. I wouldn't say that. I'd say we're all kind of in the same fairway. Certainly, some of our JV and royalty is in highly attractive sweet spots. And I think the economics on that are very good for our partners or our operators where we hold the royalty interest. And I wouldn't say there's significant enough variation between our program and what we see with others to describe it as a two-speed program if that was the question. Thanks very much, Alastair.

Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered strong second-quarter financial results, with revenue coming in above the midpoint of guidance and profitability increasing by a double-digit percentage driven by higher-than-expected sales of our Instinct, Ryzen, and EPYC processors. We continued accelerating our AI traction as leading cloud and enterprise providers expanded availability of Instinct MI300X solutions, and we also saw positive demand signals for general-purpose compute in both our client and server processor businesses. As a result, second-quarter revenue increased 9% year over year to $5.8 billion as significantly higher sales of our data center and client processors more than offset declines in gaming and embedded product sales. We also expanded gross margin by more than three percentage points and grew EPS 19% as data center product sales accounted for nearly 50% of overall sales in the quarter. Turning to the segments. Data center segment revenue increased 115% year over year to a record $2.8 billion, driven by the steep ramp of Instinct MI300 GPU shipments and a strong double-digit percentage increase in EPYC CPU sales. Cloud adoption remains strong as hyperscalers deploy fourth-gen EPYC CPUs to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. We are seeing hyperscalers select EPYC processors to power a larger portion of their applications and workloads, displacing incumbent offerings across their infrastructure with AMD solutions that offer clear performance and efficiency advantages. The number of AMD-powered cloud instances available from the largest providers has increased 34% from a year ago to more than 900. We are seeing strong pull for these instances with both enterprise and cloud-first businesses. As an example, Netflix and Uber both recently selected fourth-gen EPYC public cloud instances as one of the key solutions to power their mission-critical customer-facing workloads. In the enterprise, sell-through increased by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple large wins in the quarter with financial services, technology, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and transportation customers, including Adobe, Boeing, Industrial Light & Magic, Optiver, and Siemens. Importantly, more than one-third of our enterprise server wins in the first half of the year were with businesses deploying EPYC in their data centers for the first time, highlighting our success attracting new customers while also continuing to expand our footprint with existing customers. Looking ahead, our next-generation Turin family featuring our new Zen 5 core is looking very strong. Zen 5 is a grounds-up new core design optimized for leadership performance and efficiency. Turin will extend our TCO leadership by offering up to 192 cores and 384 threads, support for the latest memory and I/O technologies, and the ability to drop into existing fourth-gen EPYC platforms. We publicly previewed Turin for the first time in June, demonstrating our significant performance advantages in multiple compute-intensive workloads. We also passed a major milestone in the second quarter as we started Turin production shipments to lead cloud customers. Production is ramping now ahead of launch, and we expect broad OEM and cloud availability later this year. Turning to our data center AI business. We delivered our third straight quarter of record data center GPU revenue with MI300 quarterly revenue exceeding $1 billion for the first time. Microsoft expanded their use of MI300X accelerators to power GPT-4 Turbo and multiple copilot services, including Microsoft 365 Chat, Word, and Teams. Microsoft also became the first large hyperscaler to announce general availability of public MI300X instances in the quarter. The new Azure VMs leverage the industry-leading compute performance and memory capacity of MI300X in conjunction with the latest ROCm software to deliver leadership inferencing price performance when running the latest frontier models, including GPT-4. Hugging Face was one of the first customers to adopt the new Azure instances, enabling enterprise and AI customers to deploy hundreds of thousands of models on MI300X GPUs with one click. Our enterprise and cloud AI customer pipeline grew in the quarter, and we are working very closely with our system and cloud partners to ramp availability of MI300 solutions to address growing customer demand. Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Super Micro all have Instinct platforms in production, and multiple hyperscale and Tier 2 cloud providers are on track to launch MI300 instances this quarter. On the AI software front, we made significant progress enhancing support and features across our software stack, making it easier to deploy high-performance AI solutions on our platforms. We also continued to work with the open-source community to enable customers to implement the latest AI algorithms. As an example, AMD support for Flash Attention 2 algorithm was upstreamed, providing out-of-the-box support for AMD hardware in the popular library that can increase training and inference performance on large transformer models. Our work with the model community also continued accelerating, highlighted by the launches of new models and frameworks with Day 1 support for AMD hardware. At Computex, I was joined by the co-CEO of Stable Diffusion to announce that MI300 is the first GPU to support their latest SD 3.0 Image Generation LLM. Last week, we were proud to note that multiple partners use ROCm and MI300X to announce support for the latest Llama 3.1 models, including their 405 billion parameter version that is the industry's first frontier-level open-source AI model. Llama 3.1 runs seamlessly on MI300 accelerators. And because of our leadership memory capacity, we're also able to run the FP16 version of the Llama 3.1 405B model in a single server, simplifying deployment and fine-tuning of the industry-leading model and providing significant TCO advantages. Earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Silo AI, Europe's largest private AI lab with extensive experience developing tailored AI solutions for multiple enterprise and embedded customers, including Allianz, Ericsson, Finnair, Karber, Nokia, Philips, T-Mobile, and Unilever. The Silo team significantly expands our capability to service large enterprise customers looking to optimize their AI solutions for AMD hardware. Silo also brings deep expertise in large language model development, which will help accelerate optimization of AMD inference and training solutions. In addition to our acquisitions of Silo AI, Mipsology, and Nod.ai, we have invested over $125 million across a dozen AI companies in the last 12 months to expand the AMD AI ecosystem, support partners, and advance leadership AMD computing platforms. Looking ahead, from a road map perspective, we are accelerating and expanding our Instinct road map to deliver an annual cadence of AI accelerators, starting with the launch of MI325X later this year. MI325X leverages the same infrastructure as MI300 and extends our generative AI performance leadership by offering twice the memory capacity and 1.3 times more peak compute performance than competitive offerings. We plan to follow MI325X with the MI350 series in 2025 based on the new CDNA 4 architecture, which is on track to deliver a 35x increase in performance compared to CDNA 3. And our MI400 series powered by the CDNA Next architecture is making great progress in development and is scheduled to launch in 2026. Turning to our AI solutions work. Broadcom, Cisco, HP Enterprise, Intel, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, all joined us to announce Ultra Accelerator Link, an industry-standard technology to connect hundreds of AI accelerators that is based on AMD's proven Infinity Fabric technology. By combining UALink with the widely supported Ultra Ethernet consortium specification, the industry is coming together to establish a standardized approach for building the next generation of high-performance data center AI solutions at scale. In summary, customer response to our multiyear Instinct and ROCm road maps is overwhelmingly positive and we're very pleased with the momentum we are building. As a result, we now expect data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the $4 billion we guided in April. Turning to our client segment. Revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 49% year over year, driven by strong demand for our prior-generation Ryzen processors and initial shipments of our next-generation Zen 5 processors. In PC applications, Zen 5 delivers an average of 16% more instructions per clock than our industry-leading previous generation of Ryzen processors. For desktops, our upcoming Ryzen 9000 series processors dropped into existing AM5 motherboards and extends our performance and energy efficiency leadership across productivity, gaming, and content creation workloads. For notebooks, we announced our Ryzen AI 300 series that extends our industry-leading CPU and GPU performance and introduces the industry's fastest NPU with 50 tops of AI compute performance for Copilot+ PCs. The first Ryzen AI 300 Series notebooks went on sale over the weekend to strong reviews, and more than 100 Ryzen AI 300 Series premium, gaming, and commercial platforms are on track to launch from Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, and others over the coming quarters. Customer excitement for our new Ryzen processors is very strong, and we are well positioned for ongoing revenue share gains based on the strength of our leadership portfolio and design win momentum. Now, turning to our gaming segment. Revenue declined 59% year over year to $648 million as semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections. Semi-custom demand remains soft as we are now in the fifth year of the console cycle, and we expect sales to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half. In gaming graphics, revenue increased year over year, driven by improved sales of our Radeon 6000 and 7000 Series GPUs in the channel. Turning to our embedded segment. Revenue decreased 41% year over year to $861 million. The first quarter marked the bottom for our embedded segment revenue. Although second-quarter revenue was flattish sequentially, we saw early signs of order patterns improving and expect embedded revenue to gradually recover in the second half of the year. Longer term, we are building strong design win momentum for our expanded embedded portfolio. Design wins in the first half of the year increased by more than 40% from the prior year to greater than $7 billion, including multiple triple-digit million-dollar wins, combining our Adaptive and x86 compute products. We announced our Alveo V80 accelerators that deliver leadership capabilities in memory-intensive workloads and entered early access on next-generation edge AI solutions with more than 30 key partners on our upcoming second-gen Versal Adaptive SoCs. Last week, we also announced Victor Peng, President of AMD, would retire at the end of August. Victor has made significant contributions to Xilinx and AMD, including helping scale our embedded business and leading our cross-company AI strategy. On a personal note, Victor has been a great partner to me, ensuring the success of our Xilinx acquisition and integration. On behalf of all of the AMD employees and board, I want to thank Victor for all of his contributions to AMD's success and wish him all the best in his retirement. In summary, we delivered strong second-quarter results and are well-positioned to grow revenue significantly in the second half of the year, driven by our data center and client segments. Our data center GPU business is on a steep growth trajectory as shipments ramp across an expanding set of customers. We're also seeing strong demand for our next-generation Zen 5, EPYC, and Ryzen processors that deliver leadership performance and efficiency in both data center and client workloads. Looking ahead, the rapid advances in generative AI and development of more capable models are driving demand for more compute across all markets. Under this backdrop, we see strong growth opportunities over the coming years and are significantly increasing hardware, software, and solutions investments with a laser focus on delivering an annual cadence of leadership data center GPU hardware, integrating industry-leading AI capabilities across our entire product portfolio, enabling full-stack software capabilities, amplifying our ROCm development with the scale and speed of the open source community, and providing customers with turnkey solutions that accelerate the time to market for AMD-based AI systems. We are excited about the unprecedented opportunities in front of us and are well-positioned to drive our next phase of significant growth. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our second-quarter results. Jean? Jean Hu -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter. We are very pleased with our overall second quarter financial results that came in above expectations. On a year-over-year basis, data center segment revenue more than doubled, client segment revenue grew significantly, and we expanded the gross margin by 340 basis points. For the second quarter of 2024, revenue was $5.8 billion, up 9% year over year as revenue growth in the data center and the client segments was partially offset by lower revenue in our gaming and embedded segment. Revenue increased 7% sequentially, primarily driven by growth in the data center and client segments revenue. Gross margin was 53%, up 340 basis points year over year, primarily driven by higher data center revenue. Operating expenses were $1.8 billion, an increase of 15% year over year as we continue to invest in R&D to address the significant AI growth opportunities ahead of us and enhanced go-to-market activities. Operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 22% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense, and other was $138 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69, an increase of 19% year over year. Now, turning to our reportable segments. Starting with data center, data center delivered record quarterly segment revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115%, a $1.5 billion increase year over year. The data center segment accounted for nearly 50% of total revenue, led primarily by the steep ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs and a strong double-digit percentage EPYC server revenue growth. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 21%, driven primarily by strong momentum in AMD Instinct GPUs. Data center segment operating income was $743 million or 26% of revenue compared to $147 million or 11% a year ago. Operating income was up more than five times from the prior year, driven by higher revenue and operating leverage even as we significantly increased our investment in R&D. Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 49% year over year and 9% sequentially, driven primarily by AMD Ryzen processor sales. Client segment operating income was $89 million or 6% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $69 million a year ago. Gaming segment revenue was $648 million, down 59% year over year and 30% sequentially. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to semi-custom inventory digestion and the lower-end market demand. Gaming segment operating income was $77 million or 12% of revenue compared to $225 million or 14% a year ago. Embedded segment revenue was $861 million, down 41% year over year as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels. On a sequential basis, embedded segment revenue was up 2%. Embedded segment operating income was $345 million or 40% of revenue compared to $757 million or 52% a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $593 million in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $439 million. Inventory increased sequentially by $339 million to $5 billion, primarily to support the continued ramp of data center GPU products. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $5.3 billion. In the second quarter, we returned $352 million to shareholders, repurchasing 2.3 million shares, and we have $5.2 billion of authorization remaining. During the quarter, we retired $750 million of debt that matured this past June, utilizing existing cash. Now, turning to our third quarter 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow approximately 15%, primarily driven by strong growth in the data center and client segment. We expect embedded segment revenue to be up and the gaming segment to decline by double-digit percentage. Year over year, we expect revenue to grow approximately 16%, driven by the steep ramp of our AMD Instinct processors and strong server and client revenue growth to more than offset the declines in the gaming and the embedded segment. In addition, we expect third quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 53.5%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.9 billion, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. Also during the third quarter, we expect to close the acquisition of Silo AI for approximately $665 million in cash. In closing, we made significant progress during the quarter toward achieving our financial goals. We delivered record MI300 revenue that exceeded $1 billion and demonstrated solid traction with our next-gen Ryzen and EPYC product. We expanded gross margin significantly and drove earnings growth while increasing investment in AI. Looking forward, the opportunities ahead of us are unprecedented. We'll remain focused on executing to our long-term growth strategy while driving financial discipline and operational excellence. With that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session. Mitch Haws -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you, Jane. John, we're happy to poll the audience for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you, Mitch. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] One moment, please, while we poll for questions. And the first question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Ben Reitzes -- Melius Research -- Analyst Hey, thanks a lot, and congratulations on these results. Lisa, I wanted to ask you about MI300, how you see it playing out sequentially for the rest of the year. I guess there's about $2.8 billion left to hit your annual target. So, I'm wondering if you see things picking up in the fourth quarter and how that's going sequentially. And if you don't mind, I wanted to also ask about next year if you see potential for rapid growth. You're probably aware of some of the chatter out there, and I just was wondering if you're already seeing signs that you can grow significantly, given your road map for next year. Thank you so much. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Great, Ben. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, on sort of MI300 and the customer evolution, we're very happy with how MI300 has progressed. When we started the year, I think the key point for us was to get our products into our customers' data centers, to have them qualify their workloads, to really ramp in production, and then see what the production capabilities are, especially performance and all of those things. And I can say now being sort of more than halfway through the year, we've seen great progress across the board. As we look into the second half of the year, I think we would expect that MI300 revenue would continue to ramp in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we're continuing to expand both current deployments with our existing customers, as well as we have a large pipeline of customers that we're working through that are getting familiar with our architecture and software and all that stuff. So, I would say overall, very pleased with the progress, and really continuing right on track to what we expected from the capabilities of the product. As we go into next year, I mean, one of the important things that we announced at Computex was increasing and expanding our road map. I think we feel really good about our road map. We're on track to launch MI325 later this year, and then next year, our MI350 Series, which will be very competitive with Blackwell solutions. And then we're well on our way to our CDNA Next as well. So, I think, overall, we remain quite bullish on the overall AI market. I think the market continues to need more compute. And we also feel very good that our hardware and software solutions are getting good traction, and we're continuing to expand that pipeline. Ben Reitzes -- Melius Research -- Analyst Thank you. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Aaron Rakers -- Analyst Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter as well. I guess sticking on the data center side, as we look forward and you think about the full year, I'm curious of how you're currently thinking about the EPYC server CPU growth expectations as we go forward. And any kind of updated thoughts on your ability to kind of continue to gain share in the server market? Just kind of just update us on how you see the server market playing out over the next couple of quarters. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, sure, Aaron. Thanks for the question. So, you know, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made with EPYC. I think a couple of things. First of all, in terms of competitive positioning and just the traction in the market, our fourth-gen EPYC between Gen 1 Bergamo is really doing very well. We've seen broad adoption across cloud. And then we've been very focused on enterprise as well as third-party cloud instances. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're starting to see very nice traction in enterprise with both new customers as well as existing customers, and then for third-party cloud adoption, also a good pickup there as well. So, I think overall, I think our EPYC portfolio has done well. Going into the second half of the year, I think we also feel good about it. There are a couple of positives there. We see -- first of all, the market looks like it's improving, so we have seen some return to spending in both enterprise and cloud. And so, I think those are positive market trends. And then in addition to that, we are in the process of launching Turin. So, we started production here in the second quarter and we're on track to launch broadly in the second half of the year. We'll see some revenue of Turin in the second half of the year contributing as well. So, overall, I think the server market and our ability to continue to grow share in the server market is one of the things that we see in the second half of the year. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Timothy Arcuri -- Analyst Thanks a lot. Lisa, I wanted to ask about the data center GPU road map. As you said, 325 launching later this year, so I guess I had two questions. Does the greater than $4.5 billion, does that include any revenue from 325? And can you talk a little bit more about 350? Obviously, we're seeing a big rack scale or shift toward rack-scale systems for the competition's product. And I'm wondering if that's what 350 is going to look like. Is it going to have liquid cooling and is it going to have a rack scale aspect to it? Thanks. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, let me start with your original question. I mean, I think looking at 325X, we are on track to launch later this year. From a revenue standpoint, there will be a small contribution in the fourth quarter, but it really is still mostly the MI300 capabilities. And 325 will start in the fourth quarter and then ramp more in the first half of next year. And then as we look at the 350 Series, what we're seeing and the reason we call it a series is because there will be multiple SKUs in that series that we'll go through the range of, let's call it, air-cooled to liquid-cooled. In spending time with our customers. I think there are people who certainly want more rack-level solutions, and we're certainly doing much more in terms of system-level integration for our products. You'll see us invest more in system-level integration. But we also have many customers who want to use their current infrastructure. I think the beauty of the MI350 series is it actually fits into the same infrastructure as the MI300 series. And so, it would lend itself to, let's call it, a pretty fast ramp if you've already invested in 300 or 325. So, we see the range of options, and that's part of the expansion of the road map that we're planning. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Ross Seymore -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question, and congrats on the strong results. Well, data center is obviously very important. I just want to pivot to the client side. Lisa, can you talk about the AI PC side of things, how you believe AMD is positioned? Are you seeing any competitive intensity changing with the emergence of ARM-based systems? Just wanted to see how you're expecting that to roll out and what it means to second-half seasonality. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Sure, Ross. So, first, you know, we're very pleased with our client business results. I think we have a very strong road map, so I'm very pleased with the road map. The Zen 5-based products, we're launching both notebook and desktop in this -- in the middle of this year. What we've seen is actually very positive feedback on the product. So, we just actually launched the first Strix-based notebooks over the weekend. They went on sale. You may have seen some of the reviews. The reviews are very positive. Our view of this is the AI PC is an important add to the overall PC category. As we go into the second half of the year, I think we have better seasonality in general, and we think we can do, let's call it, above-typical seasonality, given the strength of our product launches and when we're launching. And then into 2025, you're going to see AI PCs across sort of a larger set of price points, which will also open up more opportunities. So, overall, I would say the PC market is a good revenue growth opportunity for us. The business is performing well. The products are strong. And we're working very closely with both the ecosystem partners as well as our OEM partners to have strong launches here into the second half of the year. Ross Seymore -- Analyst And is the ARM side changing anything or not really? Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer You know, look, I think at this point, the PC market is a big market, and we are underrepresented in the market. I would say that we take all of our competition very seriously. That being the case, I think our products are very well-positioned. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Matt Ramsay -- Analyst Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to maybe draw a parallel between the Instinct portfolio that your company is rolling out now and what you guys did five or six years ago with EPYC. And I remember when the Naples product launched, there was a lot of, I would say, reaction positively and negatively and sort of sentiment around where your road map might go to relatively small perturbations in what the volumes were. Super early, but if I remember back to that, what was the most important was that was the toehold into the market for long-term engagement, both on the software side and the hardware side with your customers two, three, four generations forward. So, is that an accurate parallel to where you guys are with MI300? And maybe you could talk about the level of engagement, the intensity of engagement, the breadth of it across the customer base with 350 and 400. Thanks. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, absolutely, Matt. So, look, as I said earlier, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making on the Instinct road map. This is absolutely a long-term play so absolutely, you're correct. It has a lot of parallels to the EPYC journey, where you really have to -- you gain more opportunities, broader workloads, larger deployments as you go from generation to generation. So, we are playing the long game here. Our conversations with our customers, so I would start with first, in the near term, we had some very key milestones that we wanted to pass this year. And as I said, they related to getting hardware in volume in multiple hyperscalers as well as large Tier 2 customers. We've done that. We've now seen our software in a lot of different environments, and it's matured substantially. ROCm is in very, from a standpoint of features, functions, out-of-box performance, getting to performance with customers, we've gained a lot of confidence and learned a lot in that whole process. The networking aspects of building out the rack scale and the system-level items are areas that we're continuing to invest in. And then the point of having long-term conversations across multiple generations is also really important. So, I think all of those things have progressed well. We view this as very good progress for MI300, but we have a lot more to do. And I think the various road maps will help us open up those opportunities over the next couple of years. Matt Ramsay -- Analyst Appreciate it. Thank you. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Matt. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question. Vivek Arya -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, there seems to be this ongoing industry debate about AI monetization and whether your customers are getting the right ROI on their capex. And today, they have these three options, right? They can buy GPUs from your largest competitor with all the software bells and whistles and incumbency, or they can do custom chips, or they can buy from AMD. So, how do you think this plays out next year? Do you think your customers, given all this concern around monetization, does it make them consolidate their capex around just the other two suppliers? How is your visibility going into next year, given this industry debate? And how will AMD continue to kind of carve a position between these two other competitive choices that are out there? Thank you. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, sure, Vivek. Well, I mean, I think you talk to a lot of the same people that we talk to. I think the overall view on AI investment is we have to invest. I mean, the industry has to invest. The potential of AI is so large to impact the way enterprises operate and all that stuff. So, I think the investment cycle will continue to be strong. And then relative to the various choices for the size of the market, I firmly believe that there will be multiple solutions, whether you're talking about GPUs or you're talking about custom chips or ASICs, there will be multiple solutions. In our case, I think we've demonstrated a really strong road map and the ability to partner well with our customers. And from the standpoint of that deep engagement, hardware, software co-optimization is so important in that. And for large language models, GPUs are still the architecture of choice. So, I think the opportunity is very large. And I think our piece of that is really strong technology with strong partnerships with the key AI market makers. Vivek Arya -- Analyst Thank you, Lisa. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Vivek. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Joe Moore -- Analyst Great. Thank you. I also wanted to ask about MI300. I wonder if you could talk about training versus inference. Do you have a sense -- I know that a lot of the initial focus was inference, but do you have traction on the training side? And any sense of what that split may look like over time? Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question, Joe. So, as we said on MI300, there are lots of great characteristics about it. One of it -- one of them is our memory bandwidth and memory capacity is leading the industry. From that standpoint, the early deployments have largely been inference in most cases, and we've seen fantastic performance from an inference standpoint. We also have customers that are doing training. We've also seen that from a training standpoint, we've optimized quite a bit our ROCm software stack to make it easier for people to train on AMD. And I do expect that we'll continue to ramp training over time. As we go forward, I think you'll see -- the belief is that inference will be larger than training from a market standpoint. But from an AMD standpoint, I would expect both inference and training to be growth opportunities for us. Joe Moore -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Toshiya Hari -- Analyst Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had a question on the MI300 as well. Curiously, if you're currently shipping to demand or if the updated annual forecast of $4.5 billion is in some shape or form supply constrained, think last quarter, you gave some comments on HBM and CoAs. Curious if you could provide an update there. And then my Part B to my question is on profitability for MI300. I think in the past, you've talked about the business being accretive and improving further over time as you sort of work through the kinks, if you will. Has that view evolved or changed at all given sort of the competitive intensity and your need to invest, whether it be through organic R&D or some of the acquisitions you've made? Or are you still confident that profit margins in the business continue to expand? Thank you. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Sure, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So, on the supply side, let me make a couple of comments and then maybe I'll let Jean comment on sort of the trajectory for the business. So, on the supply side, we made great progress in the second quarter. We ramped up supply significantly exceeding $1 billion in the quarter. I think the team has executed really well. We continue to see line of sight to continue increasing supply as we go through the second half of the year. But I will say that the overall supply chain is tight and will remain tight through 2025. So, under that backdrop, we have great partnerships across the supply chain. We've been building additional capacity and capability there. And so, we expect to continue to ramp as we go through the year. And we'll continue to work both supply as well as demand opportunities, and really that's accelerating our customer adoption overall, and we'll see how things play out as we go into the second half of this year. Jean Hu -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yeah. On your second question about the profitability, first, our team has done a tremendous job to ramp the product MI300. It's a very complex product so we ramped it successfully. At the same time, the team also started to implement operational optimization to continue to improve gross margin. So, we continue to see the gross margin improvement. Over time, in the longer term, we do believe gross margin will be accretive to corporate average. From a profitability perspective, AMD always invests in platforms. If you look at our data center platform, especially both the server and the data center GPU side, we are ramping the revenue. The business model can leverage very significantly even from GPU side. Because the revenue ramp has been quite significant, the operating margin continued to expand. We definitely want to continue to invest as the opportunity is huge. At the same time, it is a profitable business already. Toshiya Hari -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. Stacy Rasgon -- Analyst Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig into the Q3 guidance a little bit if I could. So, with gaming down double digits, it probably means you've got close to $1 billion of growth revenue across data center, client, and embedded. I was wondering if you could give us some color on how that $1 billion-ish splits out across those three businesses. Like if I had 70% of it going to data center and 20% going to client and 10% going to embedded, like would that be like way off? Or how should we think about that apportioning out across the segments? Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe Stacy, let me give you the following color. So, the gaming business is down double digit as you state. Think of it as the data center is the largest piece of it, client, next. And then on the embedded side, think of it as single-digit sequential growth. Stacy Rasgon -- Analyst Got it. So, I mean, within that data center piece then, how does that split out? I mean, is the bulk of the data growth Instinct? Or is it sort of equally weighted between Instinct and EPYC? Or like again, how does it -- again, if you got, I don't know, $400 million to $600 million of sequential data center growth or something like that, how does it split up? Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, again, without being that granular, we will see both -- certainly, the Instinct GPUs will grow, and we'll see also very nice growth on the server side. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Harsh Kumar -- Analyst Yeah. Hey, Lisa, from my rudimentary understanding, the large difference between your Instinct products and the adoption versus your nearest competitor is kind of rack level performance and that rack level is the structure that you may be lacking. You talked a little bit about UALink. I was wondering if you could expand on that and give us some more color on when that might -- when that gap might be closed. Or is this a major step for the industry to close that gap? Just any color would be appreciated. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, Harsh, overall, maybe if I take a step back and just talk about how the systems are evolving, there's no question that the systems are getting more complex, especially as you go into large training clusters, and our customers need help to put those together. And that includes the sort of Infinity Fabric-type solutions that are the basis for the UALink things as well as just general rack-level system integration. I think what you should expect, Harsh is, first of all, we're very pleased with all of the partners that have come together for UALink. We think that's an important capability. But we have all of the pieces of this already within sort of the AMD umbrella with our Infinity Fabric, with the work with our networking capability through the acquisition of Pensando. And then you'll see us invest more in this area. So, this is part of how we help customers get to market faster is by investing in all of the components, so the CPUs, the GPUs, the networking capability as well as system-level solutions. Harsh Kumar -- Analyst Thank you, Lisa. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Harsh. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Blayne Curtis -- Analyst Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask another question on MI300. Just curious if you can kind of characterize the makeup of the customers in the first half. I know you had, end of last year, a government customer. Is there still a government contingency? And kind of the second part of it is really you've invested in all these software assets. Kind of curious the challenge of ramping the next wave of customers. I know there's been a lot of talk on some hardware challenges, memory issues, and such, but then you're investing in software. I'm sure that's a big challenge, too. Just kind of curious what the biggest hurdle is for you to kind of get that next wave of customers ramp. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, Blayne, a lot of pieces to that question so let me try to address them. First, on your question about, I think you're basically asking about the supercomputing piece. That was mainly Q4 and a bit in Q1. So, if you think about our Q2 revenue, think about it as almost all AI. So, it's MI300X, it's for large AI, hyperscalers as well as OEM customers going to enterprise and Tier 2 data centers. So, that's the makeup of the customer set. And then in terms of the various pieces of what we're doing, I think first on your question about memory, I think there's a lot of noise in the system. I wouldn't really pay attention to all that noise in the system. I mean, this has been an incredible ramp. And I'm actually really proud of what the team has done in terms of just definitely fastest product ramp that we've ever done to $1 billion here in the -- over $1 billion in the second quarter and then ramping each quarter in Q3 and Q4. In terms of memory, we have multiple suppliers that we've qualified on HBM3. And it's a tricky -- memory is a tricky business, but I think we've done it very well and that's there. And then we're also qualifying HBM3E for future products with multiple memory suppliers as well. So, to your overarching question of what are the things that we're doing, the exciting part of this is that the ROCm capability has really gotten substantially better because so many customers have been using it. And with that, what we look at is out-of-box performance, how long does it take a customer to get up and running on MI300? And we've seen, depending on the software that companies are using, particularly if you're based on some of the higher-level frameworks like PyTorch, etc., we can be out-of-the-box running very well in a very short amount of time, like, let's call it, very small number of weeks. And that's great because that's expanding the overall portfolio. We are going to continue to invest in software, and that was one of the reasons that we did the Silo AI acquisition. It's a great acquisition for us. 300 scientists and engineers. These are engineers that have experience with AMD hardware and are very, very good at helping customers get up and running on AMD hardware. And that's -- so we view this as the opportunity to expand the customer base with talent like Silo AI, like Nod.ai which brought a lot of compiler talent. And then we continue to hire quite a bit organically. So, I think Jean said earlier that we see leverage in the model, but we're going to continue to invest because this opportunity is huge, and we have all of the pieces. This is just about building out scale. Blayne Curtis -- Analyst Thanks so much. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst Hey, Lisa. Thanks for taking my question. I'll give you a breather from the MI300 for a second, but just to focus on client in the second half. No problem. Focused on client in the second half, you kind of said above seasonal for September, December. You're obviously launching a new notebook, desktop product, but you're also talking about AI PC. Could you just break down where you're seeing those above-seasonal trends? Is it the ASP uplift you're getting from the new products? Is it a unit assumption that's coming with AI PC? Just any kind of breakdown between those two and why you're seeing it a little bit better. Thank you. Lisa T. Su -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure, Tom. So, I think you actually said it well. We are launching Zen 5 desktops and notebooks with volume ramping in the third quarter. And that's the primary reason that we see above seasonal. The AI PC element is certainly one element of that, but there is just the overall refresh. Usually, desktop launches going into a third quarter are good for us, and we feel that the products are very well-positioned. So, those are the primary reasons. Operator And our final question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Danely -- Analyst Hey, gang, thanks for sneaking me in. Just a question on gross margin. So, if we look at your guidance, it seems like the incremental gross margin is dropping a little bit for Q3. Why is that happening? And then just a follow-up on another part of the gross margin angle. Have you changed your gross margin expectations for the MI300? Has the accretion point moved out a little bit? Jean Hu -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Chris, thanks for the question. I think, first, we have made a lot of progress, as you mentioned, this year to expand our gross margin from 2023 at a 50 percentage point to -- you know, we actually guided 53.5% for Q3. The primary driver is really the faster data center business growth. If you look at the data center business as a percentage of revenue from 37% in Q4 last year to now close to 50%. That faster expansion really helped us with the gross margin. When you look at the second half, we'll continue to see data center to be the major driver of our top-line revenue growth, will help with the margin expansion. But there are some other puts and takes. I think Lisa mentioned the PC business actually is going to do better in second half, especially typically, seasonally, it tends to be more consumer-focused. So, that really is a little bit different dynamics there. Secondly, I would say embedded business, we are going to see embedded business to be up sequentially each quarter. But the recovery, as we mentioned earlier, is more gradual. So, when you look at the balance of the picture, that's why we see the gross margin -- the pace of the gross margin changed a little bit, but we do see continued gross margin expansion. As far as MI300, we are quite confident over the long term, it will be accretive to our corporate average. We feel pretty good about the overall data center business to continue to be absolutely the driver of gross margin expansion. Christopher Danely -- Analyst Thank you. Operator I would like to turn the floor back over to Mitch for any closing comments. Mitch Haws -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. That concludes today's call.

         "2024 isn't quite in the books, but it's already been a banner year for stocks. Through Nov. 21, the S&P 500 is up 24.7% year to date, led by big tech stocks like the \"Magnificent Seven\" as artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be the dominant narrative on the stock market. Given that, you might expect the top-performing Vanguard exchange-traded fund (ETF) to hail from the tech sector. After all, Nvidia stock has roughly tripled this year, but the Nasdaq Composite is only slightly outperforming the S&P 500 with a gain of 26.4% and the popular Nasdaq-100 has underperformed the broad-market index with a return of 23.3%. It might come as a surprise, but the best-performing Vanguard ETF has nothing to do with tech. Instead, it's the Vanguard Financials Index Fund ETF ( VFH 1.25% ) , which is up 33.6% year to date through Nov. 21. As you can see from the chart below, the financials sector tracked with the S&P 500 for much of the year before gaining some separation in the fourth quarter and surging on the election result. ^SPX data by YCharts Why financials are ascendant The biggest holdings in the Vanguard financials ETF include the top banks, credit card companies, and a sizable position in Berkshire Hathaway , which counts insurance as its biggest segment. Financial stocks have a number of attractive qualities in the current market. First, they are highly cyclical. Banks and credit card processors see their business increase when the economy is expanding and consumers and businesses are confident in continued growth. Banks rely on loans and fees to make money, and credit card processors depend on consumers spending money as well. Both types of businesses can also benefit from high interest rates as they allow them to collect more interest on debt. So an economy with high interest rates and stable growth with low unemployment has been favorable to the financial sector. Additionally, these stocks soared after the election as investors anticipated that the incoming administration's policies would give a boost to the sector. Investors are hopeful that the Trump administration will be less restrictive with mergers and acquisitions, which is a valuable source of income for banks. In specific cases like that of Wells Fargo , investors also hope its asset cap, which restricts its ability to do business, will be lifted. Finally, investors also expect the Trump administration to cut taxes, which would be a general boon to the economy, especially for the financial sector. Can financial stocks keep climbing in 2025? Even after their rally in 2024, financial stocks still look cheap compared to the broad market. The Vanguard Financials ETF currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 16.5, which compares favorably with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF at a P/E ratio of 29.7. Financial stocks tend to be cheaper than the broad market because they are highly cyclical and vulnerable to a recession, and growth in the sector tends to be lower than, say, the tech sector. However, the ETF has reported an average annual earnings growth of 12.6% over the last five years, which is a solid clip for any group of stocks. The performance of the fund next year will likely depend on the overall health of the economy, and the Trump administration's ability to fulfill some of the expectations that Wall Street has placed on it. However, the current economic conditions seem ideal for another strong year for financial stocks as the economy is healthy, interest rates are moderately elevated, and business and consumer confidence seems to be increasing. While being the top-performing ETF two years in a row would be difficult, the Vanguard Financials ETF looks like a good bet to outperform next year as well.",

         "The first six months of 2024 was a fantastic time for investors. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite put up total returns of 15% and 19%, respectively. But not all stocks benefited from the broad rally. For example, SoFi Technologies ( SOFI -0.80% ) is down 24% this year (as of July 18). Is this fintech a smart buy right now on the dip? SoFi is disrupting a massive industry SoFi's historical growth is certainly impressive, and it's probably a key reason the stock might be on your radar. In 2023, the business reported 35% and 44% year-over-year revenue and customer growth, respectively. These figures are significantly higher than they were just a few years ago. SoFi has done a great job at expanding its offerings from student loan refinancing to personal and home loans, as well as banking and brokerage products. The potential also remains sizable. According to Wall Street average analyst estimates , SoFi is projected to increase revenue at a compound annual rate of 17.4% between 2023 and 2026. While this would represent a slowdown from previous years, it's still an outlook that shareholders should get excited about. The financial services industry in the U.S. is enormous. The four money-center banks -- namely, JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America , Wells Fargo , and Citigroup -- combined have assets of $9.5 trillion. To be clear, these large institutions offer a much wider range of products and services than SoFi does, but you get the idea of how big the industry is. SoFi's all-digital approach that emphasizes an excellent user experience will undoubtedly continue to draw in a younger demographic that can expand their banking relationship over time. And the company has no physical presence, which lowers overhead and customer acquisition costs. This positions SoFi well in a competitive industry. Show me the bottom line During most of the past decade, it seemed like the market was infatuated with businesses that were growing rapidly, even though they weren't generating positive earnings. But in a period of higher interest rates, higher inflation, and economic uncertainty, I believe investors are starting to realize that owning businesses that are financially sound might be the right move. Here's where SoFi is really starting to turn the corner. After years of losses, the company has now reported two straight quarters of net income. And the leadership team believes the bottom line is going to expand significantly in the years ahead. They think that by 2026, SoFi will report earnings per share (EPS) of $0.55 to $0.80. And in the years after, EPS will rise by 20% to 25% annually. Of course, it's difficult to make accurate predictions this far in advance. But this is certainly a reason for investors to be optimistic. I mentioned before that SoFi still has meaningful revenue and customer growth prospects. Now it appears as though the company is also promising from an earnings perspective. Why now is a good time to buy SoFi stock During SoFi's first year of trading, the stock was extremely volatile. But since the end of 2021, it has trended down. As of this writing, it trades 70% below its all-time high, even though the stock has soared 69% since the start of 2023. I believe the current valuation is compelling. The shares sport a price-to-sales ratio of 3.4, which is 17% below the historical average. For what it's worth, SoFi also trades at a discount to best-in-class JPMorgan. That might be warranted, given the larger bank is probably a safer business to own. However, SoFi does have greater potential for higher returns during the next few years. Investors looking to gain some exposure to the banking sector should seriously consider this fintech stock.",

( CCL -0.32% ) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Sep 30, 2024 , 10:00 a.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Greetings, and welcome to the Carnival Corporation plc third-quarter 2024 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Beth Roberts, senior vice president, investor relations. Thank you. You may begin. Beth Roberts -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our third-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Josh Weinstein; our chief financial officer, David Bernstein; and our chair, Micky Arison. Before we begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I will refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release. All references to ticket prices, net per diems, net yields, and adjusted cruise costs without fuel will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. References to per diems and yields will be on a net basis. Our comments may also reference cruise costs without fuel, EBITDA, net income, free cash flow, and ROIC, all of which will be on an adjusted basis unless otherwise stated.

Please visit our corporate website where our earnings press release and investor presentation can be found. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Josh. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Thanks, Beth. Before I begin, I'd like to express my support and heartfelt sympathy for all those impacted by Hurricane Helene this past week. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. With that, I'll turn to our prepared remarks. As September comes to an end and we closed out the year, I am happy to report that we are delivering well in excess of 2024 expectations. We've also built an even stronger base of business for 2025, and we're off to an unprecedented start to 2026. Our third quarter, by all accounts, was phenomenal, breaking multiple records and outperforming on every measure. Revenue hit an all-time high of almost $8 billion, a billion more than last year's record level. Record EBITDA exceeded $2.8 billion, up $600 million over last year and $160 million over guidance, and we delivered over 60% more net income than the year prior, achieving double-digit ROIC as of the end of our third quarter. These improvements were driven by high-margin same-ship yield growth across all major brands, not driven by capacity growth. And it resulted in EBITDA and operating income on a unit basis of 20% and 26%, respectively, to levels we've not seen in the last 15 years. Strong demand enabled us to increase our full-year yield guidance for the third time this year. And consistent with our historical emphasis on efficiency, we also improved our cost guidance, which enabled us to drive more revenue to the bottom line. With around 99% of our 2024 ticket revenue already on the books were poised to deliver record EBITDA of $6 billion, almost $600 million above our prior peak and $400 million above the original guidance we set in December. ROIC is expected to end the year at 10.5%, 1.5 points better than our original December guidance and almost double last year's ending point. Looking forward, the momentum continues as we actively manage the demand curve. At this point in time, 2025 is a historical high on both occupancy and price. All core deployments are at higher prices than the prior year. Every brand in our portfolio is well booked at higher pricing in 2025, demonstrating the ongoing benefit of our demand generation efforts throughout our optimized portfolio. Our baseloading strategy is continuing to work well, allowing us to take price, thanks to having pulled ahead on occupancy. In fact, in the last few months, our 2025 booked positions price advantage versus last year has actually widened for the full year and for each quarter individually. And with nearly half of 2025 already booked, we feel confident in maintaining our trajectory. While early days, the benefit of our enhanced commercial performance is carrying nicely into 2026 as we just achieved record booking volumes in the last three months for sailings that [Inaudible]. This incredibly strong book position for 2024, 2025, and 2026 drove record third-quarter customer deposits toward $7 billion, and that's along with continued growth in pre-cruise purchases of onboard revenue. It's also gratifying to note that onboard spending levels were not only up strong again this quarter. Our year-over-year improvement in onboard redeems actually accelerated from the prior quarter. In essence, all demand indicators are continuing to move in the right direction. And we have so much more in the pipeline to sustain this momentum, including the North American premier of the highly successful Sun Princess in just a few weeks. This will be followed by the introduction of her sister ship, Star Princess, the second next-generation Princess ship coming online in a year. We also continue to invest in the existing fleet with major modernization programs like AIDA Evolution expected to deliver additional revenue uplift over the coming years. As you know, we're not just going to be buoyed by our ship. I can't wait for the introduction of our game-changing Bahamian destination Celebration Key. Its five portals built for fun will open in July 2025, but it really ramps up in 2026 when Celebration Key serves as a premium call for 19 Carnival Cruise Line ships. And rest assured, we're already planning for our Phase 2 landside development to fully leverage the use of the four berths we're building. In 2026, there's also the midyear introduction of a two-berth pier at Half Moon Cay, are naturally beautiful and pristine beach, consistently rated among the top private islands in the Caribbean. These two destinations will be available to even our largest ships, further reducing fuel costs and our environmental footprint at the same time. Stay tuned as we'll be sharing more exciting reveals about Half Moon Cay in the next few months. We're also stepping up our marketing efforts in the fourth quarter, which David will touch on. Our elevated marketing investment has been working as we continue to drive demand well in excess of our capacity growth with year-to-date web visits up over 40% versus 2019; paid search up more than 60%; and natural search, up over 70%. Our brands are iterating on under creative marketing and constantly finding ways to attract more attention to the amazing product and execution we already deliver on our book, and it is continuing to pay off as we chip away at the unwarranted price disparity to land-based vacations. All of these activities, along with strong support from our travel agent partners, have allowed us to once again take share from land-based peers as we attract even more new-to-cruise guests. In fact, both new-to-cruise and repeat guests were up double-digit percentages over last year. Now, turning to our balance sheet. We expect to continue on our path toward investment grade and have a clear line of sight for further debt paydown having recently finalized our order book through 2028. We have just three ships spread over the next four years. That's one ship delivery in 2025, none in '26 and one ship in each of 2027 and 2028. This limited order book should also position us well to continue to create demand in excess of capacity growth. Our continued focus on high-margin same-ship yield growth should deliver improving EBITDA off of this year's record levels. Of course, strong and growing free cash flow and further debt reductions provide a consistent formula for ongoing improvement in our leverage metrics and a continuation in the trajectory we have experienced already this year, resulting in a two-turn improvement in debt to EBITDA in just nine months. We have certainly come a long way in a relatively short amount of time. In just two years, we've already more than doubled our revenue and are going from negative EBITDA to an expected all-time high of $6 billion this year. This remarkable achievement is all thanks to our global team. They continue to outperform as we progress through 2024 and they are also setting us up for a successful 2025. It is their continued execution that has put us firmly on the path to achieving our SEA Change targets. And just as important, they once again powered our ability to deliver unforgettable happiness to nearly 4 million guests this past quarter by providing them with extraordinary cruise vacations while honoring the integrity of every ocean we sail, place we visit, and life we touch. With that, I'll turn the call over to David. David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Josh. I'll start today with a summary of our 2024 third-quarter results. Next, I will provide the highlights of our fourth-quarter September guidance, some color on our improved full-year guidance, along with a few other things to consider for 2025. Then I'll finish up with an update on our refinancing and deleveraging efforts. Let's turn to the summary of our third-quarter results. Net income exceeded June guidance by $170 million as we outperformed once again. The outperformance was essentially driven by two things: First, favorability in revenue were $40 million as yields came in up 8.7% compared to the prior year. This was seven-tenths point better than June guidance driven by close-in strength in ticket prices as well as onboard and other spending. Second, cruise costs without fuel for available lower berth day, or ALBD, improved slightly compared to the prior year and were nearly 5 percentage points better than June guidance, which was worth over $125 million. The third quarter benefited from cost-saving opportunities, accelerated easing of inflationary pressures, benefits from one-time items and the timing of expenses between the quarters. Most of the third-quarter cruise cost benefits will flow through as an improvement to our full-year September guidance. Per diems for the third quarter improved nearly 6% versus the prior year driven by higher ticket prices and improved onboard spending on both sides of the Atlantic. At the same time, our European brands on the path back to higher occupancy levels saw outsized growth in occupancy of 5 percentage points as compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the third quarter, we reported record-setting operating results with strong demand delivering record revenues, record yields, record per diems, and record operating income. Now, two things to highlight about our fourth-quarter September guidance. The positive trends we saw in the third quarter are expected to continue in the fourth. Yield guidance growth for the fourth quarter is set at 5% over the prior year. The difference between the yield guidance for the fourth quarter and the third quarter yield improvement of 8.7% is the result of a tougher prior-year comparison as fourth-quarter 2023 per diems were up over 10% versus just 5% for the third quarter of 2023. Having said that, it is great to see that we anticipate continued strong yield growth in the fourth quarter and that it is driven primarily by price. Cruise cost without fuel per available lower berth day for the fourth quarter are expected to be up 8% like first quarter of 2024, which was up 7.3%. Both quarters are impacted by higher dry-dock days and higher advertising expenses planned, and we did have about 25 million of anticipated third-quarter costs shift to the fourth quarter. As I have said many times, relative to cruise cost per ALBD judge us on the full year and not the quarters as we often see certain cost items like dry-dock expense, advertising, and other items have different seasonalization between the quarters from year to year. 2024 is a great example of this where cruise costs without fuel per ALBD were up 7.3% in the first quarter, essentially flat in the second quarter, improved slightly in the third quarter, and are expected to be up approximately 8% in the fourth quarter. Turning to our improved full-year September guidance. Net income for September guidance is set at $1.76 billion, a $210 million improvement over our June guidance. This improvement was driven by three things: first, an improvement in yields to 10.4% by flowing through the $40 million revenue benefit from the third quarter; second, a 1 point improvement in cruise cost per ALBD to approximately 3.5% from flowing through $100 million of the $125 million cost benefit from the third quarter with $25 million reseasonalized to the fourth quarter, as I previously mentioned; and third, a benefit from fuel price and currency worth $70 million. The strong 10.4% improvement in 2024 yields is a result of the increase in all the component parts: higher ticket prices, higher onboard spending, and higher occupancy at historical levels, with all three components improving on both sides of the Atlantic. Now, a few things for you to consider for 2025. We are forecasting a capacity increase of just seven-tenths of a percent compared to 2024. We are well positioned to drive 2025 pricing higher with less inventory remaining to sell than the same time last year. We are also looking forward to the introduction of our game-changing Bahamaian destination Celebration Key in July 2025. We anticipate that Celebration Key will be a smash hit with our guests and provided excellent return on our investment. However, we do expect that the operating expenses for the destination will impact our overall year-over-year cost comparisons by about 0.5 point. In 2025, we are expecting 688 dry-dock days, an increase of 17% versus 2024, which will also impact our overall year-over-year cost comparison by about three-quarters of a point. I will finish up with a summary of our refinancing and deleveraging efforts. With record third-quarter EBITDA of 2.8 billion, our efforts to proactively manage our debt profile continue. Since June, we prepaid another $625 million of debt, bringing our total prepayments to 7.3 billion since the beginning of 2023. Additionally, we successfully upsized the borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility by nearly $500 million, bringing the total undrawn commitment to $3 billion back to its 2019 level. Furthermore, we will continue to look for more opportunistic refinancings over time. Our leverage metrics will continue to improve in 2024 as our EBITDA continues to grow, and our debt levels improve. Using our September guidance EBITDA of $6 billion, we expect better than a two-turn improvement in net debt-to-EBITDA leverage compared to year-end 2023 and approaching 4.5 times and positioning us two-thirds of the way down the path to investment-grade metrics. Looking forward, we expect substantial free cash flow driven by our ongoing focus on operational execution and among the lowest newbuild order book in decades to deliver continued improvements in our leverage metrics and our balance sheet moving us further down the road to rebuilding our financial fortress while continuing the process of transferring value from debt holders back to shareholders. Now, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] In order to allow for as many questions as possible, we ask that you each keep to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Boss -- Analyst Great. Thanks, and congrats on another really nice quarter. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Thanks, Matt. Matthew Boss -- Analyst So, Josh, on the continued momentum, maybe could you elaborate on the stronger base of business for 2025 and the record start to 2026 that you cited? Maybe if you could touch on volume and pricing trends that you're currently seeing across regions and maybe specifically in Europe. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Sure. So, probably broad-based is the best way to talk about the strength in what we're seeing on 2025. The book position is higher for both North America and our European brands, and that's consistent across the quarters as well. So, we're positioned very well. Our brands have been doing a great job of pulling forward the booking curve, and now, we get to take price, which is the goal. So, it's very encouraging. We are we're about two-thirds booked when you look at next 12 months. So, we're in a pretty enviable place. Matt, did you have a follow-up? Matthew Boss -- Analyst Yeah, thanks. So, maybe just a follow-up would be on the balance sheet. If you could speak to capital priorities from here just given the free cash flow generation and some of the changes that you've made? David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer So, basically, our priority one, two, and three is debt reduction, where you have the goal of becoming investment grade. And we do expect to see both the reduction in our debt levels, as well as the improvement in our EBITDA, achieve investment-grade metrics as part of our SEA Change program toward the end of 2026. And so, we've got plenty of time to think about other alternatives beyond that. Matthew Boss -- Analyst Great. Congrats again. Best of luck. David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Steven Wieczynski -- Analyst Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning and congratulations on the strong quarter and the outlook. So, Josh or David, this might be some of a shortsighted question. And, David, you touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks. But if we kind of think about the fourth-quarter yield guidance, it looks to us like it might be a little bit lower versus the implied guidance for the fourth quarter back in -- that you gave back in June. So, just wondering if there's anything from a -- whether it's a pricing perspective or any geography or brand, it is showing any -- I don't want to use the word softness, but I guess I have to use that word or weakening in pricing during the fourth quarter? Or are you guys just taking a more conservative view around onboard spending over the next couple of months? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Hey, Steve. This is Josh. Actually, I'm not sure of your math, but there was really no change from where we were in June guidance when it comes to the fourth quarter on the yield side. We always said -- when we came out with our guidance, frankly, in December, we were challenged a lot, particularly in the fourth quarter, and people didn't think we'd be able to actually reach breakeven year over year because the fourth quarter of '23 was so strong. So, now, we're talking about 5%, and we feel good about that. Steven Wieczynski -- Analyst OK. Gotcha. And then, Josh, I want to ask about the '25 and '26 bookings. And you talked about how you're already 50% booked for next year and in a pretty good position, it seems, like already for 2026. So, just wondering if you think about your booking window, has it expanded too much or saying that differently, are you nearing a point where you might start leaving -- you might be leaving money on the table if demand kind of stays status quo from here? And then following up on that question, just wondering if you've seen demand accelerate for bookings maybe more in late '25 and '26 that are going to be touching Celebration Key? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Sure. So, as the great point on the booking curve, the goal is not an ever-increasing booking curve. It's to maximize the revenue that we're going to generate by the time we sail. I would say this is a brand-by-brand, itinerary-by-itinerary buildup. And I would say that almost all of our brands are pretty much -- are higher year over year. There's one that's not, and that's an active decision to pull back because we want to make sure we're not leaving price on the table, exactly to your point. So, despite the fact that, overall, we're in a record position, we are looking at that, obviously, with a lot more clinical eye and making sure we're doing the right thing to optimize that revenue. When it comes to Celebration Key, clearly, there's a premium, and it's going to benefit us, in particular, if the 2026 ongoing story when we get to ramp up to about 20 ships, which is going to be pretty fantastic. And the fact that we're doing all of this that we've been able to talk about with 2024 and even into the first half of '25, it's got nothing to do with Celebration Key. This is just based on the natural demand and all the commercial activities that we're doing and delivering on board. And that's supporting real strong revenue increases. Steven Wieczynski -- Analyst Gotcha. Thanks for that, Josh. Appreciate it. Congrats, guys. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Thanks, Steve. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Robin M. Farley -- Analyst Great. Thank you. I know it's too early to give guidance for 2025 but given -- Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer You're going to ask anyway. But you're going to ask anyway. Robin M. Farley -- Analyst Let me just ask it this way, which I think is harmless. Given everything you're saying about the booked position for 2025 and even 2026 being at record levels, is it fair to say that you're off to a better start for 2025 than a typical year? So, hopefully, that's an innocent way to ask it. And then I also just want to clarify on the expense. David, I heard what you mentioned the 25 million of expense that was sort of borrowed from -- that will show up in Q4 that kind of shifted that 25 million. But was there a separate amount, and I apologize if I missed this, that was a one-time cost save this year that we should think about coming back in 2025? I just wanted to catch what that amount was and even what it was for, if you would share that? Thanks. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer OK. So, I will actually very directly answer your question. So, we are starting off even better for '25 than we did for 2024, which is shaping up to be a record year. We are higher in occupancy, and we're higher in price, and the brands are doing a great job of really trying to optimize that booking curve and revenue generation. So, that's not guidance, but it's a point in time, and that's where we are. Robin M. Farley -- Analyst OK. Thanks. David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer As far as the second question is concerned, yes, there were a couple of reasons why we reduced cost by the full point to the year. One included some one-time benefits, wasn't huge, probably about $20 million of the 100 million related to some pension credits and a few other little things for the year. Robin M. Farley -- Analyst OK. Great. Thank you. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Thanks, Robin. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Chaiken with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. Benjamin Chaiken -- Analyst Hey, good morning. On the cost side, EBITDA flow-through has been stronger than expected. It was almost 60%. Costs have been better generally for the majority of the year. Can you talk about some of the cost saves, margin opportunities you're finding? Is this simply better leveraging a fleet that is now leaner subsequent to some of the asset sales over the past few years? Or is it cost that you're actively pulling out of the business or both? Thanks. David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer No, it's not cost that we're pulling out of the business. I mean, what we're seeing is hundreds of small items across the board, across many brands, things like crew travel savings, other port savings opportunities, as well as a lot of sourcing savings, cost innovation, better leveraging our scale across all the brands. And that probably represented about half of the $100 million cost savings that we roll through for the full year. Benjamin Chaiken -- Analyst Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess for Josh, higher level. You folded P&O Australia into the Carnival brand this year. I know it was somewhat smaller scale, but do you think there's other opportunities to streamline the portfolio in a similar way going forward? Thanks. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer I'd never say never take things off the table. I think this is one of those decisions that just made a lot of sense and something that we felt pretty passionately about executing quickly. We'll continue to review our portfolio brand by brand, ship by ship. But right now, we feel real good about how we're entering 2025. Benjamin Chaiken -- Analyst Thanks. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. James Hardiman -- Analyst Hey, good morning. I wanted to dig into some of the cost commentary you gave us, David. So, 3.5% growth for this year, that seems like it's getting better, obviously, with some cost saves and maybe better inflation. I think you called out about a half a point next year for Celebration Key and another 75 bps from dry docks. I guess are there any call-outs on the other side of that equation? I don't think our starting point should be in that 5% range if we were to just take the 3.5 this year and add those two call-outs. Maybe talk us through sort of what the base level of inflation is as we think about 2025 and any other sort of positive factors that will help offset some of the negative ones for next year. David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer Well, it's -- if you know exactly what inflation is going to be over the next 15 months, let me know, but we're still trying to figure that out. There is some level of inflation that continues in our business. We'll include that within our guidance when we provide in December. Plus, we continue to work on cost-saving opportunities. You know, as I said in the June call, even though we have the best cost metrics in the business, we still believe there are opportunities in our business to further leverage our scale and to work through those opportunities as we did in the second and the third quarter, and we'll continue to do so. And we'll include some of that in our guidance, which will offset some of inflation. So, -- but stay tuned. The two things that I gave in my prepared remarks were relative to the dry docks, and the cost of Celebration Key are pretty well fixed at this point. And so, we wanted to highlight those in the prepared remarks. James Hardiman -- Analyst Got it. And then, obviously, it sounds like everything is going pretty well from a demand perspective. Maybe speak to one of the questions that we keep getting is the potential for the widening conflict in the Middle East to negatively impact your business. I mean, I -- to some degree, it would seem to help that much of that region was already vacated in 2024. I guess the hope was that, that would be a '25 tailwind. That now seems off the table. But just maybe speak to how, if at all, you expect that region to impact your business next year? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer So, we weren't banking on it getting better and hope to God it doesn't get worse -- thoughts -- everybody in the Middle East region and hoping for peace. But our business isn't really contingent on it. It's not a major source market for us, and we're not going to the region. So, unless it were to escalate to something significantly wider than the Middle East, our ships are mobile, and we're in source markets that are phenomenal for us with lots of potential. James Hardiman -- Analyst Got it. Thanks, guys. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Scholes -- Analyst Hi, guys. Good morning, everyone. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Hi, Patrick. Patrick Scholes -- Analyst Good morning. My first question, you talked about dry docks increasing next year. Can you give us a little more possible granularity on dry-dock increases or decreases for perhaps some quarters by quarter for next year modeling purposes? Thank you. David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer So, I don't have all that detailed handy, Patrick. But if you call Beth, I'm sure she can provide that to you. Patrick Scholes -- Analyst OK. Beth, we will call you. Thank you. And then second, I see there's some news out about a new cruise pier at Half Moon Cay. Do you have any longer-term plans above and beyond just a pier for Half Moon Cay, such as water parks and the like down the road? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer So -- well, I'll give you a yes and a no. So, do we have more plans? Absolutely. Do we want a water park? Absolutely not. So, the difference between Celebration Key and what we're building at -- and pardon me, the difference between Half Moon Cay and what we're building a Celebration Key is Celebration Key is really about five portals of fun and looking to be that entertainment center. What we have at Half Moon Cay is one of the most naturally beautiful white sand beach, Crescent Shape islands in the Caribbean. And that's a true private destination and something that we want to enhance. And we will be talking about that more over the coming months. I won't steal Christine's thunder, but good things coming that are going to make that in a pretty amazing destination and of itself for a completely different reason. Patrick Scholes -- Analyst Great. Sounds great. Thank you. All set. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandt Montour -- Analyst Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just starting off, we haven't really touched on SEA Change and your three-year targets there. We kind of got a little bit of an update in the release. I guess the question is, Josh, with this new '24 full-year guidance, obviously, we can calculate the progress you're making, and we can look at that number and sort of imply some KPIs yields cost to get to those targets. And it's implying a pretty narrow spread between those two. And would give us the sense that if we harken back to your – what you gave us in the investor day, what you were thinking for per diems that were sustainable and costs that were sustainable that we would think you could do better. So, I guess if you could just – I know that, that was a long-winded way of asking the same question that you've already gotten twice. But if you could just give us a sense for how you think about the business in the current operating environment given all the positive commentary you've said today vis-a-vis those longer-term targets. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Well, I think the teams around the world are doing a phenomenal job. And if you think about – in December, we were saying up 8.5 points on percent on yields, up 4.5% cost, which gets us to 9% ROIC. And now, we're seeing up almost 10.5% on yield, only up 3.5% on cost. It gets us to 10.5% on ROIC. So, clearly, we're outperforming the expectations. It gets us about 75% of the way there for two of the metrics, the EBITDA per ALBD and the ROIC after one year with two years remaining and carbon is progressing as expected. We're about 50% there after one year. So, the teams aren't doing all those things to make targets. They're doing those things to make their guests happy and provide great business results and the outcome that's going to be hitting those targets. Do I want to hit them early? Yes, do I want to get further than that? Absolutely. But we'll take that in stride, and we'll probably talk more when we get to December guidance, and you could put that in context where we'll end in 2025 and then take it from there. Brandt Montour -- Analyst OK. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up. Maybe, Josh, if you could address the broader land-based leisure demand environment. What we're seeing elsewhere is not what cruise has seen, we see steady, slow somewhat softer normalization. We don't get any of that from you in your commentary today. I guess, we understand why it's happening, but if the rest of the world is narrowing a little bit toward narrowing your, let's say, your gap from the top. Do you see any of that affecting your consumers' behavior and willingness to spend and pricing sensitivity? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer We are still a remarkable value to land-based alternatives. And maybe land-base is softening because we're doing better. Who knows? You have to ask them that. I can't tell you their business. But we have a tremendous value. We are doing a better job of getting our word out better marketing, more eyes on the industry, more eyes on us. Our new-to-cruise this past quarter was up about 17% year over year. That's not an accident. That's because our brands are really focused on driving that demand profile. So, I don't have a crystal ball, and I can't tell you what the world is going to look like a year from now, two years from now. But I can tell you if we keep focusing on commercial execution and doing the right things and doing them better, then there's a long runway because the one thing that's never been a question is can we execute on board and deliver a great experience. And that's always been the case. It's just a matter of how we convince people to come with us who have never have, and I think we're doing a good job on that. Brandt Montour -- Analyst Great. Congrats on the quarter. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Thank you. I guess, I'd be remiss if I didn't shout out the travel agents because all they do is amplify our voice in a tremendous way. And so, that success that we're seeing in building that demand profile is really hand in hand with their success, and we appreciate their efforts. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Conor Cunningham -- Analyst Everyone, thank you. Maybe sticking with that -- the comments on new-to-cruise. Can you -- I mean, look at your 2025 bookings, are you seeing new-to-cruise and new-to-brand accelerate? And if you could just touch on just the younger demographic. I think I asked you that last quarter, but it just -- it seems like a pretty big mega trend for you over the long term. Thanks. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Well -- sorry, I just got distracted -- as far as what the demand profile is for the future bookings, we don't really talk about that in advance, but we're happy to talk about it when we get to our results, and we can talk about what the breakdown is for the profile of folks who sailed. But suffice it to say, everything I'm saying is not ending in 2024 with respect to our efforts to keep optimizing and keep getting better at execution, keep driving that demand profile, and casting that net as widely as we can. We have almost no capacity growth. So, all of that increased demand is just going to result in who wants pay the most to get on our ships, and that's what we're driving for. Conor Cunningham -- Analyst OK. David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And as far as the average age is concerned, I think we touched on this last quarter. I mean, if you look back at all of our brands over the last 10, 12 years or so, the average age for most of the brands really hasn't changed. Now, of course, the repeat guest who sailed a decade ago or 10 years old, but the average age of our guests. So, we are attracting a lot of new young people and some of our brands like Carnival Cruise Lines has an average age of like 41 years old. So, that's a brand, obviously, millennials these days are, I think it's 43 or 44 years old or younger. And that does represent half the -- over half the population in the United States. But Carnival has got over half of its guests for millennials because the average age is 41 or younger. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer But I would say -- I think I said this on either the last call or the call before, we love boomers, right? And we love Gen X. I mean, it is -- if you think about our portfolio approach, we have brands like Holland America, like Cunard where that is where they're trying to push that demand profile because it's folks a very good income, a very good retirement base and a lot of time to take cruises that can go 14 nights, 21 nights world cruises. So, we love the fact that we're pushing harder into that millennial generation, and we're getting that interest and that demand profile. But we don't want that to the exclusion of really leaning into the other generations for what we have to offer. Conor Cunningham -- Analyst Helpful. On Celebration Key, I know you've gotten a lot of questions on that. Just it is opening in mid of next year. Is it creating the halo effect that you would have expected? Like are people asking for -- or maybe they're asking a little bit different. I think you mentioned 19 ships are going to touch there. Like are those ones selling out quicker than you would have expected reverse relative to history in general? Thank you. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Unfortunately, because every carnival ship is going, there's no test case. But -- so, yes, we are seeing a premium for it. We are seeing people that are seeking it out. And the good thing is it hasn't even opened yet. So, we think the rubber is really going to hit the road once we can deliver the experience and really show people what it can do. Conor Cunningham -- Analyst Appreciate it. Thank you. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David Katz -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Hi, David. David Katz -- Analyst Hi. I appreciate all the details so far. And it's interesting when we look across our coverage, there are some smaller pockets of weakness that consumers have started to demonstrate here and there. And this is a broadly based positive quarter. And I just wanted to double-click on the issue of are there any small pockets, any areas of consumer behavior that we should just keep an eye on as we go forward that are, again, embedded in what appears to be a pretty broad-based strong quarter and outlook? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Yes. No, I appreciate the question. I guess I'm happy that I just have to say no. What we're seeing is, in fact, broad-based. We're seeing that demand for all the brands pretty much across the portfolio. What we're seeing it in the booking trends that we've talked about, the onboard spending. The onboard spending levels were 7% up year over year. That's off the top of my head. Am I off by a point? Something like that. David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer [Inaudible] more than this second quarter -- Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Yeah, 6.7%. Onboard per diems were 6.7% year over year, which is an acceleration versus the increase that we saw in second quarter versus the prior year. So, all things that you look at is our -- is that demand profile changing or the state of the consumer changing, I can't speak to macroeconomics, because there's a lot going on in the world, but at least with what we have to offer, people are happy to pay and to participate. And we think that's a great thing. And we think that goes back to all the things that we've been talking about for the last two years about where we want to focus and make sure that we are doing a better and better job as time goes on. David Katz -- Analyst Perfect. And if I can, just as my follow-up, are you able to observe or record any trade-down dynamics where part of the demand you're seeing is a consumer who's traded out of something else into a cruise vacation? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer No, nothing that we've seen that says that. I mean I think it's the opposite. It's -- we're doing a better job of convincing them. This is something they want to do, not because they're trading down from something, but that they want to experience what we have to offer. David Katz -- Analyst OK. And I apologize for the questions. My ratings get mixed up. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer No, no. I think they were good. They were good questions. I think they're good questions. David Katz -- Analyst OK. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Very fair. David Katz -- Analyst Congrats on the quarter. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Yep. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Jaime Katz -- Morningstar -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. I'm curious if you have any update on, I guess, the Chinese consumer? Is it trending as you would like or Asia Pacific in general? Just because the data that's been coming out of the region has been a little bit lumpy, and it was obviously something that was pretty meaningful prior to the pandemic. Thanks. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Yes. Hi, Jaime. It wasn't very meaningful for us prior to the pandemic and the grand scheme of things. It was a few percentage points of our capacity that was really dedicated to China. We have -- as I've been pretty open about, I'm ecstatic that it's reopened to international cruising. I wanted to be very successful for our competitors, but it's not something that we're pursuing at this time and have not. With respect to the region overall, when it comes to Japan, Taiwan and other regions, that's going well. People like cruising with us before, and they continue to enjoy it now. Jaime Katz -- Morningstar -- Analyst Yeah. I was just curious if there was any movement with them with outbound travel more so than anything else. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Yeah. Jaime Katz -- Morningstar -- Analyst As far as occupancy in the European brands, is there a little bit of room left in that for upside? Or has the gap sort of closed on that? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer I mean, overall, we're back to historical norms, which is a range. It's not a number. And I'd say all of our brands, to varying degrees, have the ability to maybe addressed a little higher here and there. It's not going to be a big driver of our improvement as we look forward. It's really going to be from driving price, which is where we're focused. But there's always an opportunity to make some tweaks and find some more occupancy. Jaime Katz -- Morningstar -- Analyst And I don't think you guys had mentioned anything on any hurricane impact, but any insight to the cost of that disruption if you have it, would be helpful? Thanks. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Yeah. I mean, ours is -- it's insignificant compared to the impact that it's having on the region, which, first and foremost, we should take a second to just think about. But putting that aside, it's a few million dollars for us. It's not anything of significance. Jaime Katz -- Morningstar -- Analyst Excellent. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research. Please proceed with your question. Assia Georgieva -- Infinity Research -- Analyst Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. And I'll just delve into the few quick questions that I have. Occupancy is still not fully caught up relative to fiscal 2019. Isn't that by itself already a yield opportunity? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Yes. Like I said, we operate in a range for occupancy, and we are within our range, but there's certainly the opportunity to push that a little bit more. It's just not going to be the biggest driver of how we can improve the revenue picture going forward. Assia Georgieva -- Infinity Research -- Analyst And maybe a quick question for David. Fuel costs seem to be a little bit -- well, quite a bit higher relative to what we were estimating because we track for 180, 380 MGO. Could that possibly be related to shore power in the Baltics, Denmark, Germany ports that are offering shore power Sweden, etc. Is that part of the play there? David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer No, because our shore power, when we buy it, is actually not included in the fuel expense. It's included in port expenses because we purchased it at the port. So, that would not have been an impact. So, I'm not sure what you're looking at and what you're tracking. But Beth can give you some websites to look at, which maybe will improve your tracking overall. Assia Georgieva -- Infinity Research -- Analyst That would be great. And, Beth, I'm sorry, I'll bother you on this one. And basically, my second question, given the acceleration in EBITDA generation and how far ahead you're with the SEA Change program, is it possible at this point to order a sister ship for 2027, 2028 delivery, whether it's for a Princess brand or Carnival brand? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer No. I mean, our order book is set through 2028. We feel very good about that. And as you know, we did order what we call Project ACE, which is next generation for Carnival, but that doesn't start until 2029. So, the focus of all that EBITDA generation is really its cash flow, and we're going to use the headroom with a reduced capital expenditures to pay down debt. Assia Georgieva -- Infinity Research -- Analyst So, Josh, in terms of the debt tranches, we're going after the highest cost of debt, correct? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Well, as long as it's got a good NPV if we want to pay it down. So, there's a lot of factors. Yes, go ahead. David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer I was going to say it's really a combination of three things that we look at. One is the cost of the debt. And we do have two double-digit issuances out there. Both are callable in 2025. So, that should help our overall -- when we -- we'll look at refinancing those in the early part of next year. We also look at the maturity towers. We're well set through 2026 on maturity towers. They're very well managed. But the towers in '27 and '28, we'll be looking at refinancing some of that as well as looking at secured versus unsecured debt. Because our goal is to get to be completely unsecured, but we'll manage that over time as we move forward. Assia Georgieva -- Infinity Research -- Analyst And, David, that was basically my question, high cost versus secured towers. So, it's a balancing act, I imagine? David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer Correct. Assia Georgieva -- Infinity Research -- Analyst All right. And lastly, if I may ask somebody is encroaching on your Galveston, Texas port and building a terminal there. What do you think about that? They already have a presence in Miami and are doing Port Canaveral, etc., an unnamed competitor, who do not have to report to us on ROIC or other metrics. How do you feel about sort of the -- what I call the encroachment? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer I don't think about it as an encroachment. We are 2% of the overall vacation market. And if it's the company, I think you're talking about, it's a small part of the overall cruise market growing, but small. And so, there's -- the demand profile as long as we do our jobs with our world-class portfolio of brands, we'll be just fine. I got to cut you off though. You did three questions, and the operator only said one. Sorry. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Dan Politzer -- Analyst Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Josh, I do want to follow-up on the fourth quarter yield comment. I know you mentioned that there really wasn't much if any -- actually, any change to your prior guide. But as we think about the third quarter came in better, David, cited better close-in demand and on board driving the beat. I mean, is there any reason that wouldn't be in the cards for the fourth quarter? Or are there near-term demand hiccups or noise, whether it's a new cycle or election that could be maybe driving additional conservatism? Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Look, we try to give you our best estimate of what's going to happen. And do we always try to outperform? Absolutely. That's the goal. There's nothing in particular about the fourth quarter other than what other than what you said. I mean, right, the next month, a lot of attention is going to be focused on something other than what's normal. It happens every four years. So, we'll see kind of impact that has. But the business is still going strong, and we expect a lot of ourselves. David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. And also keep in mind, with 99% of the ticket revenue for the for the gear already on the books, there's not a lot left to sell, yes. Dan Politzer -- Analyst Right. No, that makes sense. And then just for my follow-up. In a couple of weeks, you're hosting some investors aboard Sun Princess. Any way to kind of think about maybe framework and maybe kind of the key topics we should focus on? It seems like there's a lot progress on SEA Change, your Celebration Key, maybe some of these cost opportunities or savings from easing inflation. But what are the kind of the key high-level focus points we should be thinking about? Thanks. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Look, it's been -- it's been about 15 months since we got together for the first time to talk about what our priorities were and announced SEA Change. And think it's a good opportunity for us to just kind of level set on where we are and everything. And hopefully, as you see it, the way we see it, which is the progress that we're making across board. We also get an opportunity to showcase the Princess brand and specifically the Sun Princess, which is just a true game changer for Princess. And I'd say for the premium market, she's a remarkable ship and the team on board does a remarkable job. And you also get an opportunity, not just to hear from me, but you'll -- and David, but you'll be able to hear from the president of that brand and to actually meet the presidents of pretty much all of our brands who will be there with us. So, good opportunity for you to get a little bit more educated and inundated by all things Carnival Corporation. Dan Politzer -- Analyst That's great. Thanks so much, and congrats on a nice quarter. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Thanks a lot, Daniel. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos with SIG. Please proceed with your question. Chris Stathoulopoulos -- Analyst Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Josh, I'm going to ask the demand question here in a different way. As we think about global travel and tourism and think about different segments, if you will, within the ecosystem, so lodging, airlines, hearing sort of a different dynamic here as we think about demand, certainly within lodging, lower- to middle-income consumer, some concerns around price sensitivity, little bit of a mixed bag in airlines. In cruise lines, this is unique here with what feels like this sort of persistent demand and just kind of ongoing momentum, if you if you will. Now, I was wondering could rank order or think about the moving pieces as to the why. So, there's the new-to-cruise piece, I would say perhaps a later reopening of certain markets, strong U.S. dollar, discount to land-based trips, baseloading. Just if you could help us provide -- provide some context as we think about the moving parts of demand here. There's still some debate around whether this is any pent-up demand here, which I think is just not the case? Or what -- is this actual base load going forward? Thanks. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Well, I guess, the most affirmative thing I'll say is completely agree with you. It's not pent-up demand anymore. We've been sailing for over three years now. So, I don't -- I think that, that is coming down. I'm not going to answer your question by rank ordering, but I would say that when it comes to all of industry, I think we're all doing a pretty good job at that demand generation and creation and getting awareness, getting people interested in cruising who maybe have never thought about it before. With respect to us, there is a lot of activity going on at all of our brands to really just try to do better and better blocking and tackling when it comes to the commercial operations, right​? Generating new creative, generating more eyeballs in performance marketing looking for and then being looked at by the right potential customer, driving people to our trade partners, driving people to our websites, doing everything we can to just get the word out and get them interested. And I think that's part of what's driving us in a pretty significant way. Chris Stathoulopoulos -- Analyst OK. And then as my follow-up, David, so my math here, I have about a point and a quarter on the adjusted NCCs for next year, and we can come up with our own assumptions, as you said, on inflation. But as we think about the other moving pieces here, puts and takes, on the advertising side, I know I think that's expected to be elevated in 4Q. Is there a reason? Or how should we think about next year? And do we need this level of advertising per ALBD to continue? Is it part of the baseload book plan? Or can we expect that to sort of get softer, if you will, as that initiative continues to take hold. Thanks. David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, the advertising as well as many other decisions are things that we really need to talk about over the next month or two in the planning process, which we're in the midst of doing. And we'll give guidance in December relative to all of those items. It would be premature for us to be making a decision today exactly what we want to do, particularly for next summer or the back half of next year in advertising. So, we'll give you more insight into that in three months. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer I'd just add a couple of things. One is, remember, we just talked about a record-setting 2026 booking period. So, we're not just booking for the short-term. We're booking for the long-term. And advertising is a combination of getting people to consider things for the longer term and getting the ships filled as we need to in the shorter term. So the metric of just looking at it on an ALBD basis is, it's useful for benchmarking, but it's not too scientific. It's really about how much bookings we want to generate and how we think we need to spend to go get it. And I think we're doing a good job. And when you do look at rest of the benchmark basis, even though we're higher than we were back in 2019, and I think a couple of percent higher year over year, we're still quite a bit lower than most if not everyone. So, we'll continue to be thoughtful about it and do what we think we need to do to drive the business. I think we got time for one more. Chris Stathoulopoulos -- Analyst Thank you. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Yes, thank you. I think we've got time for one more if there are any more, operator? Operator Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Fred Wightman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Fred Wightman -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to come back to new-to-cruise, Josh. I think you said that was up 17% this quarter. Last quarter, that was up 10%. So, it's a pretty big acceleration per brand that's as big as you guys are. Can you touch on what drove that? Was there a reallocation of some of the ad spend? And maybe how you think strategically that could sort of increase that penetration step from 2% to something larger as a percentage of total vacation spend? Thanks. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer Yes. So, there's no one thing that's going to be the answer for driving new-to-cruise either. It is that same combination of better advertising, the trade doing a great job, better usability of our websites. I'd say Alaska, in particular, for this past year was off the charts. It was absolutely phenomenal, and that tends to skew higher to new-to-cruise because -- if you're going to go to Alaska, which everybody should go do, the only way you can go see it is by a cruise ship to really appreciate it. And the only way you should do that is by one of our brands because they do it amazingly, and we have more permits for Glacier Bay than anybody else. And we have the shoreside footprint that nobody else has and can replicate. So, that has served us very, very well. And I'd say it's the same things that you've heard me talk about in the past quarters that hopefully, I'll continue to talk about in the quarters to come about just doing the basics better. Fred Wightman -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Thank you. Josh Weinstein -- President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Climate Officer I appreciate it. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us and look forward to talking again in a few months for those of you that I don't see next week. Take care.

         "Target ( TGT 12.56% ) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Aug 21, 2024 , 8:00 a.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation's second quarter earnings release conference call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 21, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead, sir. John R. Hulbert -- Vice President, Investor Relations Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive officer; Rick Gomez, chief commercial officer; and Michael Fiddelke, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. In a few moments, Brian, Rick and Michael will provide their insights on our second quarter performance, along with our outlook and priorities for the third quarter and remainder of the year. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who will be listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. Also, in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our investor relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the second quarter and his priorities for the third quarter and beyond. Brian? Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start my remarks today by welcoming Rick Gomez to this call, following his recent move into the role of chief commercial officer. This change was one of several we announced in June, including Christina Hennington's move into the role of chief strategy and growth officer, and Lisa Roath's transition into the role of chief merchandising officer of food, essentials and beauty. Lisa has done a fantastic job leading our marketing team and I've asked her to remaining that role until early 2025. This will provide adequate time for us to complete an external search for her successor before Lisa brings her impressive commercial leadership experience back into the merchandising team. These changes follow our January announcement that Michael would move into the pivotal role of our chief operating officer. Michael took on the CFO role just before the pandemic, and he's done an outstanding job leading the company through a period of unprecedented growth and volatility. The search for Michael replacement as CFO is ongoing, and I share Michael's excitement for the time when he is able to fully focus on his new role leading all of our operational functions. And of course, we were pleased this month to welcome Amy Tu into the role of chief legal and compliance officer. During her career, Amy has served in key leadership roles for several Fortune 100 companies. And I'm excited to welcome her to the Target team. Amy is taking the place of Don Liu on our team as he prepares for his retirement. I want to pause to thank Don for his many years of thoughtful and conscientious service to Target and our stakeholders. He is an outstanding leader who has served as a trusted partner to me, to our board and our entire leadership team during his tenure here at Target. All of these changes on our team are just the latest evidence of our focus on developing enterprise leaders, ones who go well beyond subject matter expertise to develop strong leadership skills, with a foundation based on a comprehensive understanding of our business and how we fit into the broader landscape. And as you've seen from our second quarter results, the strength of our entire team was clearly evident in our financial performance, which came in well above our expectations. On the top line, we met our goal of returning to growth, but moved well beyond that baseline expectation. More specifically, our Q2 comparable sales grew 2% at the very top end of our guidance range. And on the bottom line for the quarter, our EPS of $2.57 was well above the high end of our guidance, representing growth of more than 42% over last year. Among the drivers of our comp sales, we're pleased that our second quarter growth was driven entirely by traffic, reflecting the combined benefits of the multiple guest-focused initiatives we outlined in our financial community meeting back in March. It's also notable that our store and digital channels both saw growth in Q2. Our digital team has done an outstanding job of enhancing our digital experience, and that's showing through in our business results. We saw high single-digit growth in our digital comps in Q2 and even faster growth in same-day services, led by Drive Up and Target Circle 360, both of which grew in the low teens. Same-day services now account for more than two thirds of sales, with the biggest contribution from Drive Up, which generated sales of more than $2 billion in Q2 and more than $4 billion so far this year. Our balanced, multi-category merchandising assortment continues to resonate with our guests as trends strengthened across the board in Q2. And we're encouraged to see discretionary category trends improved for the fourth consecutive quarter. In Apparel, comp sales grew by more than 3%, marking an improvement of more than 5 percentage points when compared with the first quarter. Our Apparel team has done a fantastic job incorporating great design, newness and value throughout their assortment, most notably in our All In Motion brand, which delivered growth in the low teens. Beauty was another standout as the category continues to gain share, with comp growth of 9% in Q2 on top of double-digit growth a year ago. On the frequency side of our assortment, both our Food & Beverage and essential categories saw traffic growth in the quarter as consumers are responding to our offerings in an environment where they are focused on value. Over the summer, we reduced our prices on about 5,000 frequently purchased items in many markets, and we saw an acceleration in both our unit and dollar sales trends in these businesses. We're also seeing continued momentum in our Target Circle loyalty platform following its relaunch in the first quarter. With over 100 million members, we're always happy to welcome guests who choose to join, and we added more than 2 million new users in the second quarter. But our aspirations go well beyond growing our membership base. We redesigned Target Circle with a goal of increasing engagement among existing members, and we've already realized the benefits. For example, during our July Target Circle Week, about two thirds of our transactions were made by Target Circle members. Beyond the direct benefit of guest engagement with the platform, Target Circle also helps us gain deep consumer insights, allowing us to extend more personal, customized offers through our Roundel advertising business. Roundel continued to experience rapid growth. based on the joint value it creates for both our guests and our vendors. In the second quarter, Roundel delivered double-digit growth to the benefit of both gross margin and the other revenue line of our P&L. For the full year, Roundel is expected to grow in the high teens on top of more than 20% growth in 2023. As we continue to survey consumers and monitor the external environment, our view remains largely the same as we've been sharing for some time. Consumers have shown remarkable resilience in the face of multiple challenges over the last several years, and they remain resilient today. Given the significant headwinds they faced with inflation over the last few years, consumers continue to focus on value as they work hard to manage their household budgets. And while they continue to turn out and shop around holidays and other seasonal moments, many are delaying purchases until the moment of need. Against that backdrop, our team continues to focus on providing unbeatable value for our guests. And of course, that starts with a focus on low everyday prices, including our recent price reductions on frequently purchased items. But our focus on value only begins with low prices. Whether we're highlighting compelling deals for our Target Circle members, offering an additional 5% savings to our Target Circle cardholders, designing and sourcing high-quality owned brands at compelling prices or delivery, ease and convenience with Drive Up and Target Circle 360, our team is continually working to find more ways to deliver more value for our guests. As we look ahead, our team is focused on controlling what we can control. We're committed to staying on offense while maintaining an overall cautious outlook, a stance that has worked well for us over the last few quarters. Throughout the company, we're focused on retail fundamentals and strong execution. This includes our commitment to being in stock and reliable even as we maintain a prudent inventory position. It also includes our focus on delivering speed and convenience in every fulfillment channel, while providing efficient and friendly service to our guests in every store, every day. We're also looking to build on the momentum we've been seeing in discretionary categories where trends have already improved significantly, and we see much more opportunity ahead of us. We're focused on continued expansion of our operating margin rate. As we move back toward and potentially beyond the 6% annual rate we were earning before the pandemic. We're committed to continued disciplined capital deployment. Following more than a year of hard work to strengthen our balance sheet, we were pleased to get back to share repurchases in the second quarter, and we expect to have continued capacity within our Middle A ratings in Q3 and beyond. And of course, we're focused on continued investment in our team, in their training, development, pay and benefits. To support our team, we're making smart investments in AI technology to make their work easier and more productive, enable them to serve our guests with even greater speed and efficiency. All of these efforts are in support of our ultimate goal: To deepen the already strong relationship we have established with our guests. But while it was fantastic to see top line growth in the second quarter, it was even more gratifying that was driven by traffic. As more guests choose to make more trips to Target, following unprecedented growth during the pandemic. Altogether, over the first six months of 2024, our guests have already made nearly 1 billion trips to target, a number that's grown by more than 20% since 2019. We're grateful for the underlying trust and engagement behind every one of those transactions, and our entire team is focused on delivering continued traffic growth over time. So now before I turn the call over to Rick, I want to pause and thank our team. Back at our Financial Community Meeting in March, I described how they were united in their commitment to moving from go time to grow time, and they've certainly delivered and more. In an environment where consumers continue to make meaningful trade-offs, -- our Q2 results demonstrate the power that comes from the right combination of newness, seasonal relevance and compelling value. While that's great to see, the team isn't pausing to celebrate. Rather, they're leaning in as they focus on building additional momentum in the back half of the year and beyond. Our team is the best in retail, they're guest-focused and they love to win together, and they're just getting started. With that, I'll welcome Rick to his first earnings call. Rick Gomez -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be joining this call today, and I'm looking forward to meeting many of you over time. Before we unpack our second quarter results, I'd like to spend some time sharing my priorities as I step into this role, many of which should sound very familiar. First, I want to reinforce the importance of the areas that Christina was focused on: affordability, newness, seasonal relevance and ease. These are mission-critical. Under Christina's leadership over the years, we've built an incredible foundation which we can build upon. I've also worked with the team on three additional principles to govern how we work. First, we'll focus on simplifying processes end to end, including how our teams work together, as well as with our external partners, with the goal of driving efficiencies and streamlining how work gets done. We should also be relentless in our pursuit of creativity, bringing innovative ideas to market that are original, inspiring and unmistakably Target. And finally, we shouldn't be just guest-led, we should be consumer-obsessed. We'll do this by consistently listening to what consumers want and need and then working hard to deliver for them. Next, I'll turn to our view of the consumer, which, as you heard from Brian, has remained largely unchanged for some time. American families continue to deal with a lot. These pressures are clearly weighing on them, and they're looking for a refuge from the everyday stress that they're feeling. And yet while the economic data remains mixed, we see a consumer that is still willing and able to spend. Yes, they're still being choiceful. Yes, they're budget conscious. And yes, they're hunting for deals and everyday value. But they're also willing to shop when they find that right combination of fashion and newness at the right price. This was on full display in our second quarter results. As Brian mentioned, the team was committed to returning to growth this year, and they did just that in Q2 with comp growth of 2% driven entirely by traffic. Also note, every one of our core categories saw traffic growth in the quarter. Sales from Target Circle 360 grew in the low teens this quarter, adding to our confidence that we have a long runway ahead of us to drive awareness and adoption of this differentiated service. In support of this goal, we recently rolled out a new monthly subscription option for Target Circle 360, allowing guests to get the best of Target delivered same day for just $10.99 per month and only $4.99 per month for students. Within our assortment in Q2, we saw notable areas of strength in both discretionary and frequency categories. As Brian highlighted, discretionary trends have been improving for a full year now, and combined discretionary comps were down only slightly in Q2. This momentum was most evident in our Apparel assortment, which delivered low single-digit comp growth driven by newness in combination with strong everyday value, both in stores and online. Comps were led by our performance category in the low double digits as guests loved our latest designs and unbeatable prices in our All In Motion brand. Women's apparel saw growth in the low to mid-single digits, with particular strength in our young contemporary owned brand, Wild Fable. And our recent relaunch of our intimates and sleepwear brand, Auden, has seen a strong guest reaction out of the gate, offering high quality and comfortable items at compelling price points, like $15 bras and $20 pajama sets. These results demonstrate the broad-based improvements that we're seeing in Apparel, a trend we are eager to build on in the coming quarters and years. While our Home and Hardlines trends remain softer than Apparel, we've also seen meaningful trend improvement over the last year. In Home, Q2 comps accelerated by more than 7 percentage points compared with the first quarter and early results in the back-to-school season are right on plan. Within Home, kitchen continues to stand out based in part on our recent launch of Figmint, our high-performance Kitchenware brand. Within Hardlines, while sales and electronics are still under pressure, we've been leaning into other categories with stronger demand, driving a comp trend improvement of around 5 percentage points versus Q1, driven by newness in the category. Key growth areas include our affordable outdoor offerings in many markets like $1 pulled noodles and $10 coolers. Recently, we launched more than 1,000 new items in toys, including over 100 new items in our own brand, Gigglescape, which now includes preschool toys, games, puzzles and an expansion into plush. And in case there was any question of the love for our brand with young shoppers, some of the fastest-growing sales in toys are from Target-themed items, including plush bullseye dogs, kid-sized Target checkout lanes, Target branded poly pocket toys, Target-branded Fisher-Price little people and so much more. Beauty continues to gain meaningful market share with comp growth in the high single digits in Q2, driven by a balanced combination of new offerings, celebrity brands and seasonal relevance. This has been a summer of Sun Care with guests looking for familiar, affordable options like Up and Up Sunscreen, as well as newer trending brands such as Vacation. Minis have also been a major growth driver, with travel on the rise and consumers looking for a little bit of affordable indulgence for at-home too. In Food, comp sales growth in the low single digits was led by seasonal moments, with hundreds of new items across snacking, grilling and entertaining. With exclusive to Target items like Buble's Melted Ice Pop Flavor, which quickly grew to be the highest selling item in its category, we help guests celebrate summer with fun new flavors and items. In addition to seasonal moments, we've also pushed ourselves to rethink assortment strategies that have been tried and true for years. For example, we transitioned our candy aisles, leading into some of the most popular trends like better-for-you options, including lower sugar treats and wellness candies. While this category is already growing, these changes raise the bar, accelerating comp growth into the double digits. In Essentials, which also grew in the low single digits overall, Sales growth was largely driven by strength in our category, where protein drinks, powders and meal supplements are gaining momentum. Additionally, Baby Care and essentials continue to do well. Across categories, our own brands grew faster than the total enterprise, showcasing the relevance, quality and value we provide to consumers. In fact, because of our industry-leading design and sourcing capabilities, we are better positioned to remove unnecessary steps in the process, which allows us to reduce costs and increase speed to market. Throughout the second quarter, Target Circle members took advantage of enticing promotions, particularly during our latest Target Circle Week. In fact, this year's Target Circle Week has generated the highest digital traffic of the year so far. As Brian mentioned, we added more than 2 million new Target Circle members in the second quarter while also adding hundreds of thousands of Target Circle cardholders and Target Circle 360 members. Because of the invaluable insights we gained through Target Circle, we were able to offer four times more personalized offers as compared to a year ago. And of course, those same insights fuel our Roundel media network, which, as Brian mentioned, continues to benefit our business in multiple ways. While it's hard to believe that summer is already coming to an end, our focus is quickly turning to fall. This, of course, begins with a continuation of our back-to-school and college seasons, which reached their peak in the front half of Q3. More than 70% of our guests shop us during this time frame, and we have plenty in store for them to start the school year off with success and stock. Knowing affordability is top of mind for consumers, in many markets this year, we're offering 20 of the most popular school supply items that together are priced under $20, including items like Mondo Lama crayons for just $0.25, notebooks for $0.50 and $5 backpacks. For our college-bound guests, we're offering a 20% discount to get their dorm room stocked, styled and ready for study. And as we do every year, we're acknowledging the true classrooms heroes, our teachers, with a special appreciation event offering an additional 20% of must-have supplies. As the fall season continues, we'll be introducing more and more newness across our assortment to celebrate all things autumn. In our performance category, we're offering new assortments from All In Motion, including our first-ever women's legging destination with new fabrications and a range of colors, sizes and silhouettes to make all bodies look and feel their best. In our women's categories, we're leaning into our fall fashion assortment, which includes wardrobe options anchored in head-to-toe on-trend neutrals and showcasing the disruptive value of core items for just $15. And new this year, we are showing out for the game day in a big way, with mix and match apparel items in your favorite college team colors to show some school spirit in style. Beyond fall fashion, we know consumers are eager for their apple and pumpkin spice favorites, so we're excited to bring back these fall flavors while introducing some new and trending ones as well. Our fall food assortment will offer more than 150 new owned brand items and more than 500 new national brand items, ranging from Pumpkin Donut Holes and Jack-o-Lantern sandwich cookies, to Pecan Pie ice cream and Good & Gather turkey stuffing flavored potato chips. From sweet to savory, guests will find all their favorites and be inspired by what will surely become some new favorites too. And while Halloween may seem far away, our consumer research and early season sales suggest there's a lot of excitement around this year's celebrations. Last year, social media was ablaze with videos of our 8-foot-tall Halloween pumpkin ghoul, Lewis. So we had to bring him back this season along with several new friends, all with their own sassy personalities and catch phrases. We're bringing that own brand love to our custom assortment to. Of course, we're standing to all for all the biggest characters of the season, but we're also seeing an outsized response to our Target branded costumes. And with 75% of the Halloween assortment new this year, we are confident guest will see Target as the Halloween destination for the season. As it turns out, which has come out for more than Halloween, one of the most anticipated films of the year, Universal Pictures' Wicked hits theaters this fall and our assortment will leave guests spellbound with a collection of licensed products that range from toys to apparel to housewares. We have big plans in store, including exclusive items to Target and we'll have more exciting details to share very soon. And of course, we don't have to wait for a changing of the season to change up our assortment. In Beauty, after years of meaningful investments in cosmetics and skin care offerings, we're investing in all things hair care. New from L'Oreal is the biggest innovation in at-home hair coloring in years, ColorSonic. This launch is off to a great start, and we see big things ahead for this brand. And more recently, on top of our exciting launch of Jennifer Aniston's Lola B hair care line, we launched a new partnership with celebrity, Blake Lively, for her exclusive to Target line, Blake Brown Haircare, which quickly became our biggest hair care launch on record. On launch day alone, Blake Brown had the five best-selling hair care items at Target. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to express my gratitude to the entire Target team. The past several years have been anything but routine, and this team has handled every change and turn with grace and a commitment to serving the communities in which we operate. Thank you, Team Target, for all that you do for our guests and for each other. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. Michael J. Fiddelke -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Rick. I'd like to join Brian in welcoming you to your first earnings call. I'm excited about all of the long-term growth opportunities we have in front of us as we work together to deliver more for our guests, for our team and for our shareholders. As Brian mentioned, I'm temporarily wearing two hats right now as I continue in the CFO role while preparing to fully move in the COO role. And while I'm looking forward to the day when I'm only wearing the COO hat, I'm privileged to be surrounded by exceptionally talented leaders and teams that are operating with a guest-first long-term focus that's fueling our results. Every day, I see their commitment to caring, growing and winning together. Whether I walk in a store, a distribution center or the halls in our headquarters, there is no doubt in my mind that our team members are the No. 1 reason that Target is such a special place to work. As we've been highlighting for some time, the operations team is focused on reinforcing retail fundamentals following an extended period of unprecedented volatility that began more than four years ago. While this effort encompasses many processes and metrics, nothing is more important than staying in stock and being reliable for our guests. And while our in-stock measures have been improving rapidly for some time now, we're going to continue our work to improve them even more. In the second quarter, total out of stocks were more than 500 basis points lower than a year ago. Also important, out of stocks on our top items in Q2, the ones with the highest unit velocity, were more than 50% lower than total out of stocks and also better than a year ago. Notably, these out-of-stock measures would have been even more favorable if our perishable food distribution facility in Denton, Texas had not sustained major damage from a severe storm in late May, something I'll return to later in my remarks. It's also notable that our total inventory investment at the end of Q2 was slightly lower than a year ago, meaning that the out-of-stock improvements we've been seeing are the result of operational improvements, not from simply flooding our network with more inventory. Of course, we're always focused on maintaining the right amount of inventory to deliver on our reliability goals, and we're already growing our inventory in categories where demand is strong. But overall, our business has been able to sustain stronger inventory turns than we've seen historically, something you'd expect to happen given the gains in sales per store we've seen over the last five years. Another area of focus for our team is the store shopping experience, most notably in the front end at checkout. With the recent changes we've made to streamline self-checkout, while ensuring we maintain adequate staffing in our full service lanes, we're seeing notably faster checkout times in our self-service lanes. In addition, with more people using our full-service lanes, our team has been engaging with nearly 15% more guests at checkout compared with last year. And with all of these changes, we've seen a continued substantial improvement in our Net Promoter Scores regarding the purchase experience, with scores related to wait times and interactions at checkout the strongest we've seen in six years. We're also making investments in technology to make it easier for our team members to serve our guests. Earlier this year, we integrated GenAI into the handheld devices in our stores, providing our team with rapid access to best practice documentation and the ability to quickly receive straightforward responses to common questions, like how do I sign a guest up for a Target Circle card, and how do I restart the cash register in the event of a power outage. Since the full chain rollout of this new tool, our team members have leveraged the technology more than 50,000 times, giving answers in a highly efficient average chat time of less than one minute. We'll continue to refine this tool over time based on feedback from our team, but many are already telling us that it's enhanced their everyday work experience, making it easier and faster for them to help our guests. In addition, leaders in our stores are telling us they expect this new tool will be particularly helpful as we bring on new permanent and seasonal team members in advance of this year's holiday season, helping them to become more productive, more quickly than in the past. Of course, while well documented, efficient and repeatable processes are critical to maintaining quality in a large operation, it's just as important to help our team to stay nimble and able to react to unforeseen events. And our team had to deal with several weather-related challenges in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our Denton, Texas perishable food distribution center sustained significant physical damage from a storm in late May, resulting in a prolonged site closure and significant product loss at that location. Following the storm, the team reacted quickly to minimize the impact, temporarily realigning perishable food replenishment for 220 locations with other distribution nodes, while our construction and distribution teams rushed to get the facility repaired and operational before the end of the quarter. Later in the quarter, in early July, Hurricane Barrel hit landfall in Southern Texas, and our team responded quickly to help their neighbors in affected communities. When power was lost in multiple locations, our team successfully kept stores open using generators providing food, supplies and a safe place for community members to take shelter and charge their electronic devices. Our team helped to organize and deliver donations of critical supplies to their neighbors, while helping to clear debris from nearby roads in homes. And as always, our team members took care of each other from cooking meals for displaced colleagues to making sure everyone had access to emergency supplies and shelter. To support these heroic efforts in the field, we maintain a robust infrastructure, supported by a core team at our headquarters that's ready to provide communications and support when disasters happen. As part of these preparations, we reserve and preposition thousands of pallets of critical supplies throughout our distribution network, which can be quickly deployed to affected areas when events occur. We also maintain a command center at our headquarters that's equipped to monitor weather and other conditions in the areas where we operate, helping our field teams to prepare and react quickly to minimize the impact when adverse events affect our communities, colleagues and our business. And of course, we're proud to continue offering financial support in affected communities, having already made proactive donations of $2.5 million so far this year in support of our domestic and global disaster relief partners. Following Hurricane Barrel, our donations helped the American Red Cross stand up more than 10 evacuation centers in Houston. We also supported Team Rubicon as they worked to clear fallen trees, helped homeowners navigate FEMA locations for disaster assistance, aided the footprint project in providing solar generators to power homes and medical machines, and provided food, medicine and other critical supplies to the hardest hit neighborhoods. So much of our Target Forward sustainability strategy is dedicated to working across the business, to address community needs and drive meaningful and positive impact. Through Target's for philanthropy and volunteerism, and by integrating business assets to meet the needs of our communities, we aim to be present in ways that help all families thrive, knowing the guests and communities we serve are critical to the success of our business. So I want to pause and thank our entire team for their tireless efforts, both every day and especially during times of need. You serve as the face of the company in all of the communities where we live and work, and you are the biggest reason consumers love our brand. I'm proud to work with you and grateful for everything you do to support our business, our communities and your fellow team members. So now I want to pivot and provide a quick update on our sortation center strategy, which continues to benefit our business in multiple ways. A critical aspect of this strategy is faster delivery speeds as local orders processed through a sortation center arrive more than a day faster than our network average. But notably, that increase in speed doesn't require more dollars, as our unit delivery costs from a sort center are about 20% lower than our network average. On top of that direct benefit, opening a sortation center in the market frees up processing space in the stores it serves, while delivering labor savings in those locations as well. With all of these benefits, you can see why we're excited to continue expanding the reach of this capability. And just this month, we're opening our 11th sort center in the Detroit market, where it's expected to serve more than 3 million consumers. By 2028, this facility is expected to process up to 60,000 packages daily while operating in a smaller-than-average footprint. And beyond growth in the number of these facilities, our existing source centers continue to ramp up their capacity, and we're finding new ways to integrate them into our broader network. For example, our recently opened sort center in Chicago will be feeding the Detroit sortation center, increasing the number of packages eligible for next-day delivery in that market. Altogether this year, our sortation centers have processed 19% more packages than a year ago. So now I want to turn to our second quarter financial results. As Brian highlighted earlier, the 2% increase in our Q2 comp sales was driven entirely by traffic. This traffic increase was partially offset by a decline in average ticket, which included a decrease in our average selling price when compared with a year ago. As Brian mentioned, our guests continue to shop around seasonal moments, leading to strength around the Memorial Day holiday, as well as the Fourth of July and our most recent Target Circle week later in the quarter. Within the quarter, comp sales were strongest in June and July, and trends were very similar between those two months on a reported basis. Most importantly, traffic grew in all three months of the quarter. Beyond our comp sales, second quarter total revenue growth of 2.7% reflected the benefit from sales in nonmature stores and double-digit growth in other revenue, driven primarily by strong growth in our Roundel ad business. Our second quarter gross margin rate of 28.9% was about 190 basis points higher than a year ago. About 90 basis points of this improvement was driven by our merchandising strategies, which included the ongoing benefit of our efficiency work. We also saw about 40 basis points of benefit from category sales mix, which was largely offset by cost pressures from digital fulfillment and supply chain. Finally, our gross margin rate reflected about 90 basis points of benefit from lower inventory shrink, compared with 20 basis point benefit in the first quarter. While our guidance assumes that the year-over-year benefit from shrink would increase this quarter, we've seen better-than-expected results in our most recent store inventory counts, resulting in a bigger-than-expected financial benefit in Q2. Based on these updated accounts, we're now expecting our Q3 gross margin rate will also benefit from lower shrink costs, but expect the magnitude of that benefit will be less than half of what we just experienced in the second quarter. And for Q4, given the financial benefit we were already seeing a year ago, we're expecting shrink costs will be approximately flat to last year. While it's encouraging to see this progress, we'll continue our work to move shrink rates down to more sustainable levels in the years ahead, given the steep increase in shrink that our business has absorbed over the last five years. Our second quarter SG&A expense rate of 21.2% was about 30 basis points higher than a year ago. This increase reflected cost increases in multiple parts of our business, along with continued investments in our team, which were partially offset by lower remodel expenses, savings from our efficiency work and continued disciplined cost management throughout the enterprise. Overall, our Q2 operating margin rate of 6.4% was about 160 basis points higher than last year as we continue to build back our profitability from the significant headwinds we've encountered over the last couple of years. Regarding our inventory, we continue to feel good about our position. As I mentioned earlier, Q2 ending inventory on the balance sheet was slightly lower than a year ago. However, given all of the volatility we've experienced since the pandemic began, one-year comparisons can be hard to interpret. As such, we still find it useful to compare relative growth rates back to 2019. And if you perform that comparison for the second quarter, you'll see that both our sales and ending inventory have grown about 38% over those five years, reinforcing our view that we're positioned appropriately as we enter the back half of the year. Now, I'd like to turn to capital deployment and briefly reiterate our long-standing priorities. First, we look to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Next, we look to support the dividend and build on our more than 50-year record of increasing the annual dividend. And finally, we look to return any excess cash that's available after these first two uses by engaging in share repurchases over time within the limits of our late credit ratings. Regarding the first priority, we've allocated $1.3 billion to capital expenditures through the first half of the year and continue to expect full year capex in the $3 billion to $4 billion range. Regarding the second priority, we returned $509 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in Q2, representing growth of about $10 million over last year. And finally, we returned to share repurchases in the second quarter, allocating $155 million to retire 1.1 million shares of our stock. Given the work of our team to strengthen our balance sheet over the last 18 months and the simultaneous improvements we've seen in our profitability and cash flow, we were happy to get back to repurchases this quarter. We expect to have continued repurchase capacity in the back half of 2024 and in the years ahead. So now I want to end my commentary on the quarter by covering our after-tax return on invested capital, which is an important measure of the quality of both our financial results and our capital investments. Through the 12 months ending in the second quarter, our after-tax ROIC of 16.6% was nearly 3 percentage points higher than a year ago. While this is already a very strong after-tax return, our long-term financial plans envision continued growth of this metric into the high teens over time. Now, I'd like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. And while our performance has exceeded our expectations so far this year and our view of the consumer remains largely the same, the range of possibilities and the macroeconomic backdrop in consumer data and in our business remains unusually high. Against that backdrop, our experience over the last several years has shown us that a prudent outlook, while maintaining the team's agility, is the best way to position our business. As such, we've taken a measured approach to our forward-looking guidance, and our team remains ready to respond if the pace of our business turns out to be stronger. With these considerations as context, we're planning for third quarter comparable sales growth in the 0% to 2% range, and GAAP and adjusted EPS of $2.10 to $2.40. And while our full year comp guidance range remains the same at 0% to 2% growth and the breadth of possibilities remains quite wide, our baseline plan for the fall season would put us in the lower half of that range for the full year. However, in light of the strong financial performance our business has already delivered in the first half of the year, we've raised our full year GAAP and adjusted EPS range to $9 to $9.70 compared with our prior range of $8.60 to $9.60. At our Financial Community Meeting earlier this year, we provided insight into our financial aspirations over the next 10 years. At their core, those aspirations are based on two basic assumptions: healthy growth on the top line and reaching the appropriate level of profitability on the bottom line. In the second quarter, in an environment where consumers are focused on value and making tough trade-offs in their spending decisions, our team delivered newness, value and reliability to our guests, resulting in top line growth beyond our baseline expectations and even faster growth in guest traffic. And importantly, even in a challenging environment, we also expanded our Q2 operating margin rate. We are really proud of these results, which reflect the hard work and dedication of our outstanding team. At the same time, this quarter was only the first step on a much longer journey and we have a lot more work ahead of us. More specifically, with 2019 as a baseline, the second quarter was the first time in a while in which our EPS grew faster than the top line, with total revenue growth of 38% over that five-year period and EPS growth of more than 41%. Our guidance for the remainder of the year implies further expansion of both of those metrics. And based on our growth initiatives, ongoing efficiency work and continued opportunity to reduce the impact of inventory shrink, we expect to see additional progress in the years ahead. We have a clear vision of how we're going to get there and the right team in place to make it happen. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian. Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Michael. Before we turn to your questions, I want to spend a minute on a concept we've touched on before, which is the way we uniquely leverage the power of hand in our business. The recent Target is so unique, and why we've developed such a special bond with consumers is because we offer something different than everyone else in the marketplace. We offer great prices, convenience, compelling promotions and a great shopping experience. Our nearly 2,000 stores are accessible to the vast majority of the U.S. population, and we have a comprehensive suite of fast and convenient digital fulfillment options. For destination in discretionary categories like Apparel, Home and Hardlines; in frequency categories, like Essentials and Food & Beverage 'and in Beauty, which perfectly straddles both, we offer a broad range of items, serve as a convenient one-stop shop and we're well known for curating our merchandise assortment. We are a style leader. We're known for celebrating seasonal moments and we offer reliability on everyday wants and needs. When we're at our best, we achieve a proper balance between all of those aspects or go-to-market strategy, and the second quarter was a textbook example of Target being Target. I'm incredibly proud of our team for delivering better-than-expected results in an environment where consumers are facing multiple challenges. Knowing there's more work to be done. Our team is on their front foot and ready to deliver more for our guests in the third quarter and beyond. Our team's positive energy is contagious, and I look forward to working with them as they continue to move Target forward in the quarters and years ahead. So with that, we'll move to Q&A. Rick, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Kate McShane -- Analyst Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. You mentioned that you haven't seen a notable change in the consumer versus what you've seen year-to-date. Can you help us understand or reconcile your ability to get to the high end of guidance range for quarter 2, maintain the guidance range for Q3, but also flagged you are likely to get to the lower end for the same-store sales guidance range for the year? Michael J. Fiddelke -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks for the question, Kate. I think the headline is, at the start of your question, we see a consumer that's largely consistent with how we would have described the consumer over the last couple of quarters. Consumer that's been resilient overall in their spending and flat in spite of significant inflation over the last couple of years. A consumer that's choiceful, and so our combination of getting newness and value right in the second quarter led to the performance that was at the top end of our expectations. As we look at the balance of the year, we've got more of the year in front of us than is behind us, and we think it's prudent to take a review against the kind of consumer behaviors we'll be watching over the balance of the year. But importantly, that guidance is still centered on growth. We expect to continue to grow in Q3. We expect to have a growth story for the year. And you can see us playing offense appropriately against that goal, but being measured in our outlook. We think that's the right way to position the business. Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Kate, just to build on Michael's comments. I think in this environment, where there is so much consumer uncertainty, we're taking the appropriate approach to guidance in the third quarter. But as you heard from Rick and from Michael, we're continuing to play to win, and we feel very good about how we're prepared for the big seasonal moments. We're in back-to-school right now and back to college. We're excited about Halloween. And Rick and his team are planning for some unique moments during the holiday season. So I don't want anyone to be confused with what we think is the appropriate outlook for the third quarter, but the fact that we're going to continue to play offense. We're going to look to drive traffic into our stores and visit to our site, and make sure we deliver great value along with newness for our guests throughout the season. Kate McShane -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Rupesh Parikh -- Analyst Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats on a nice quarter. So I just wanted to go back to the operating margin performance during the quarter. We still had very strong delivery during the quarter. How do you feel about the sustainability of the improvement? And then, over time, getting back to that 6% plus margins on an annual basis? Michael J. Fiddelke -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thanks for the question, Rupesh. As we laid out at the start of the year, this year was going to be about progress to that better margin performance over time. And two quarters in, I just can't thank the team enough their work to put us solidly on the path of the improvement that we laid out for the year. If you unpacked the quarter, I hit on some of this in my remarks, but it always starts with the top line. So to grow the top line on a 2% comp. To see a category like Apparel -- so we like the margins in Apparel, to see that category return to growth helped us from a mix perspective. Great work by the team to continue to find efficiency within the business. And we expected a more promotional environment this year. We've certainly seen that so far. But you can see the strength on the margin line due to the team's really hard work to continue to squeeze efficiencies out of the business in ways big and small. And we're pleased with the progress we're making on shrink. Now, there's some noise quarter-to-quarter about how that will come through. So tried to unpack some of those details in my prepared remarks. But the net punch line there is ahead of where we expected to be in terms of progress on shrink too. And so, all that's adding up to an earnings result, we're certainly pleased with. And our work going forward will be continue to continue that momentum in Q3 and Q4. Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Rupesh, I'd just amplify a couple of the comments you've heard us make over the last few quarters and really recognize the focus the teams placed on fundamentals. Michael talked about the progress in reliability, improving our in-stocks. Rick talked about the improvement in value and the commitments we've made to making sure we provide value to our guests no matter where they're shopping and how they're shopping. And I think that focus on controlling the things we can control is really helping us improve our operating margin performance. But the team has been very focused on retail fundamentals, execution each and every day, both from a physical standpoint and a digital standpoint. And I think you're seeing the benefits of that pay off. Rupesh Parikh -- Analyst Great. Thank you. I'll pass it along. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. You may go ahead. Christopher Horvers -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning. My first question is, can you talk more specifically about what drove the strength in the merchandise margin strategy in the second quarter? And what are you embedding in the back half in terms of sustainability? Michael J. Fiddelke -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. There's a lot that goes into that margin line on any quarter. And so, the headlines are some we've touched on a little bit already. We've definitely seen a more promotional environment. But against that backdrop, the teams have worked hard to find efficiencies within the business. And that can show up in ways big and small. To give a tangible example, and one of the things that we've continued to see progress with is -- the most expensive thing we do in fulfilling product is shipping a brown box, and we've seen significant improvement in the cost per unit of that activity, as teams have worked to better align inventory with where we see demand. So we have to split shipments frequently. And the core productivity within those processes, big improvements in our stores team, delivering that product more efficiently as we pick and pack in the stores, and so that work adds up. And the teams have been at it for multiple quarters now, and we're seeing it pay off. Christopher Horvers -- Analyst Understood. And then, on the top line, I was just curious how you forecast the business. Obviously, the consumer has been a lot more volatile, a lot more event-driven. There seems like there was some pause in the back, half of July. As you plan the business, do you look at seasonal revenues building off the second quarter? Are you looking at stacks? Are you looking at trends versus 2019? Just some insight there in terms of how you forecast the business. Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Chris, I think you've covered many of the things we look at on an ongoing basis. And I think we factored all those different variables into our outlook for the period and the quarter. Christopher Horvers -- Analyst Thanks very much. Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Chris. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Simeon Gutman -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask on a near-term question first. It sounds like comps due in July were relatively steady. And I don't know if you talked about product back-to-school, curious about how the consumer is behaving. And then, connected to it, any expectation when the discretionary comps may inflect to positive? Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Simeon, as we sit here today, obviously, we're in the heart of back-to-school season, kind of the early chapters of back to college. And as Rick talked about, excited about the upcoming Halloween season. I think as we sit here today, we feel well prepared for those big seasonal moments, and we'll continue to make sure we lean in with a great physical and digital experience. Simeon Gutman -- Analyst Maybe one follow-up. Can I ask about price investments, the 5,000 items that have been lowered if, one, I assume you're pleased with some of the elasticity. Does it make you think about price positioning broadly? Are there opportunities to enhance the price position in other places? Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer I think we sit here today, we feel really good about the way the consumers reacted to the price investments we've made on those 5000 frequently purchased items, but it really goes beyond those investments. If you're a Target Circle member, you're getting personalized offers every time you shop. If you're using a Target Circle card, you have the opportunity for that 5% discount. If you're taking advantage of the amazing value we provide through our own brands, that's just one more way to find value when you're shopping with Target. So it's really a bundle of all those things that we do each and every day. to strengthen the relationship we have with the guests and provide them with the value they're looking for in this economic environment. Simeon Gutman -- Analyst Thank you. Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Robert Ohmes -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Outstanding quarter. I was hoping, maybe from Brian or others, you could talk about a couple of things, Target Circle penetration. It hasn't been going up is that expected to change? And also same-day delivery is still -- and I guess, Target Circle 360, as you call it, is still not growing as fast as Drive Up. Is that expected to change? And with changing these things potentially be a sales driver? And then, is there any margin implication from that on the offset? Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Robby, you've got three or four questions there. I'm going to let Michael start. I'll pick it up from there. Michael J. Fiddelke -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Importantly, Robby, I'll kind of take your second point first. We're really pleased with our Circle 360 same-day delivery business, both it and drive-up grew in the low teens. And so, we've seen some acceleration in that business on the heels of our relaunch of Circle, and so we're encouraged by that. And importantly, both of those services. We've talked about this before, but I think it warrants a reemphasis. The thing we see when people engage with Drive Up and with Circle 360 same-day delivery has been meaningfully more at Target in total, and they're in-store shopping actually increases after they become users of those services. And so, continue to watch that relationship closely and growth of those services means growth in our share of wallet as the consumers that use those services. Speaking to circle more specifically, and I believe your question was focused on Circle card penetration. We see that opportunity over time with the relaunch of Circle to bring some investment back to growing our card business. One of the things that that relaunch of Circle provides is it brings the core base Circle program, where guests can find incredible value through the personalized offers that they receive every day; with the Circle card program, where you can save an extra 5% if you're a Circle card member; with Circle 360 program, if you want the best of Target brought to your doorstep. And the integration of those programs, we think, provides a good umping point off over time to continue to reinvigorate the Circle card business, but that's going to be a journey of quarters and years. Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Robby, just to clarify a couple of points. From a base Circle program standpoint, we did note that while we start with a base of over 100 million members, during the July Circle Week, we saw 2 million new members join the brand. You talked about Drive Up and Target Circle 360. And Drive Up has been a very sticky service for us and just continues to grow. And during the second quarter, we saw a Drive Up grow over 14%, and a nice acceleration in Target Circle 360 same-day delivery of almost 14%. So we see tremendous opportunity to continue to expand our Target Circle 360 program. But I'd really highlight Drive Up has been a stellar performance for us for many years now and just continues to grow. It was a $2 billion business for us in the second quarter. And I think, Michael, year-to-date is almost $4 billion. So it's been a really important service that we know our guests appreciates. But to Michael's point, we know they're a Drive Up user, they're going to spend time in a target store, and we really like that combination. Robert Ohmes -- Analyst Sounds great. Thanks, Brian. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Kelly with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead. Edward Kelly -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. I was hoping that you could provide a little bit more detail on discretionary comps, still negative here. What do you think is happening with market share at this point? And then, maybe can you talk a bit about when you think that category is in total may inflect positively? Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer I'm going to let Rick talk about some of the trends we're seeing in discretionary categories. He talked about the strength in Apparel and some of those subsets within Apparel, but we're also seeing green shoots in other areas. And we certainly think that over time in categories like home, led by Kitchen, as these purchase cycles become ones that need to be replaced, you're going to see some strength in those categories. But Rick, why don't you walk through some of the trends you're seeing in discretionary categories. Rick Gomez -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer Sure. I'd be happy to give a little color commentary to the trends and what's driving those trends. And what we're seeing in discretionary is when we offer on-trend stylish product at a great price, the consumer responds. And we're seeing that in Apparel. Apparel delivered a three comp. So real bright spots was All in Motion performance brand, where the team did a fantastic job on fabrication, colors, fit. $25 leggings with a fan favorite and really demonstrated the power of fashion combined with affordability. Beyond that, Beauty is also a standout, where we see news really resonating with the guests. I mentioned in the comments, but it's really exciting to see the success of Blake Lively's new hair care line, Blake Brown. We just launched it a few weeks ago, and it is already the most successful hair care launch that we have ever had a Target. And I think this is another great example of the consumer is willing to buy when they find that right combination of on-trend, stylish product at an affordable price. And even in other businesses, I use Home as an example, consumers want to freshen up their home. They want to freshen up their look, but they need to do it on the budget. So where we see growth is things like candles, decorative accessories, throw pillows. We're seeing growth there because we're offering an inexpensive way to freshen up the look of your home. So again, it goes back to delivering stylish on-trend product at a great price. Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer And I'll give you one of my favorite examples from earlier this year, and it's a collaboration we had with our partners at Authentic Brands, leveraging the Prince brand. And while that brand has been known for tenants throughout the years, we brought the Prince category and the Prince brand into pickleball, with great new apparel, accessories and rackets. And we've created a destination and target for all Things pickleball. We know families across the country are enjoying that sport. It fits very nicely with our all-family position. And it's just one more example of when Target is Target. When we bring great design that's on trend at a great value, we see the guests reacting really positively. So you'll see Rick and his team continue to make sure that we're bringing that combination of design and on trend, great value, great newness into those categories to continue to spark greater demand. Operator, we have time for one final question today. Operator Thank you. Our final question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. You may go ahead. Corey Tarlowe -- Analyst Good morning and thank you so much for taking my questions. I was wondering if you talk a little bit about your expectations for longer-term mix of Food & Beverage over time. That's a category where you've continued to grow over the last several years, specifically since the pandemic, especially as you've widened the assortment and the number of items that you've carried in that category. So I would be really curious to hear your thoughts around the long-term trajectory for that business over time. Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Corey, I'm happy to start, and I'm going to turn it over to Rick who, obviously, was leading our Food & Beverage business. We think we have significant opportunity for growth in that space, led by the unique combination, again, of great national brand partnerships and some really strong owned brands that are connected with the consumer. So we think we're still in the early days of building out our Food business. But Rick, you've got so much experience in the space, why don't you share some of your thoughts? Rick Gomez -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer I'd be happy to offer a little color commentary on the Food & Beverage business. And as Brian said, we believe there is continued runway for the business to deliver growth, driven by a few things. The first is continued emphasis on affordability. As we talked about, the 5,000 price reductions across everyday items was incredibly well received. We'll continue to lean into value on our Food & Beverage, not just through everyday pricing, but also through personalized promotions on Circle, as well as with our own brand portfolio, which offers incredible value. The second thing that will continue to lean in to drive growth for Food & Beverage will be newness. Just going into the fall season, right now, we have a ton of new products coming, over 150 new own brand products, over 500 new national brand products. Leveraging those flavors that everybody loves for the fall. I'm talking about Pumpkin Spice, Apple, Pecan Pie, that will continue to fuel growth. And then, the last opportunity to continue to drive growth in our Food & Beverage business is around ease and convenience. Consumers have a lot on their plate, and they're looking for simple solutions, and we're very excited about the continued growth that we're seeing on both Drive Up, as well as same-day delivery, which is achieving double-digit growth in Q2, and we continue to see runway on that going forward. Brian C. Cornell -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Operator, that concludes our second quarter conference call. I appreciate everyone joining us, and we look forward to talking to you again soon.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Allison Malkin of ICR. You may begin. Allison Malkin -- Investor Relations Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Gary Friedman, chairman and chief executive officer; and Jack Preston, chief financial officer. Before we start, I would like to remind you of our legal disclaimer that we will make certain statements today that are forward-looking within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements about the outlook of our business and other matters referenced in our press release issued today. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, as well as our press release issued today, for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Please also note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinion only as of the date of this call. And we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Also, during this call, we may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust our GAAP results to eliminate the impact of certain items. You will find additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP measures in today's financial results press release. A live broadcast of this call is also available on the investor relations section of our website at ir.rh.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Great. Thank you, Allison, and welcome, everyone. I will start with our shareholder letter that was released in the last hour. The positive inflection of our business continued to gain momentum with third quarter demand increasing 13% despite operating in the worst housing market in 30 years. Our vector is increasing in both magnitude and direction with November demand up 18%, as the most prolific product transformation and platform expansion in the history of our industry continues to unfold. Our industry-leading growth is being driven by the RH brand where November demand increased 24% with the introduction of our new RH Modern Sourcebook and has continued to accelerate into December with month to date demand up 30%, demonstrating the disruptive nature of our product transformation. The performance of the RH brand reflects market share gains of 15 to 25 points in Q3, accelerating to 25 to 45 points in Q4 based on our current trends and the expectations of furniture-based retailers. We believe our collections reflect a level of design and quality inaccessible in our current market and a value proposition that is disruptive across multiple markets, positioning RH to gain significant market share for the foreseeable future. Our contract, outlet, baby and child, and teen businesses should benefit from our product transformation in 2025 as, one, the new assortment becomes more widely available to support our contract business; two, returns of the new product drive our outlet business; and three, the most successful designs are translated into smaller sizes for baby, child, and teen. We are also pleased that results for the third quarter reflected our guidance with revenues increasing 8.1%, adjusted operating margin of 15% versus 7.3% last year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.8% versus 12.4% a year ago. Based on current trends, we are raising our fourth quarter and full year guidance to Q4 total demand growth of 20% to 22% and revenue growth of 18% to 20%, Q4 adjusted operating margin of 12.2% to 13.2% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 18% to 19%, fiscal year total demand growth of 9.9% to 10.4% and revenue growth of 6.8% to 7.2%, fiscal year adjusted operating margin of 11.5% to 11.7% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.2% to 17.4%. \"Every act of creation is first an act of destruction,\" Pablo Picasso. We have worked hard to destroy the former version of ourselves and are in the process of unleashing what we believe is an exponentially more inspiring and disruptive RH brand, inclusive of the most prolific product transformation and platform expansion in the history of our industry. We believe the important investments we are making during this depressed housing cycle are creating a level of strategic separation in our industry that rivals the most important brands in the world. Our product transformation plan for the remainder of 2024 and select 2025 highlights include the second mailing of our new RH Modern Sourcebook arrived in homes in November with 54 new collections across furniture, upholstery, lighting, rugs and textiles. Based on our demand trends and confidence in the new offering, we increased our advertising investment by approximately $6 million in the quarter to further expand both page count and circulation. The quarter-to-date demand leads us to believe that this investment will prove to be a wise decision over the course of the fourth quarter and into the first half of 2025. As a reminder, post analysis of our circulation data, we decided to consolidate our RH Contemporary Sourcebook collections into the RH Interiors and RH Modern Sourcebooks to optimize overall mailing depth and efficiency. Mailing fewer, more meaningful books enables our brand to break through the compounding clutter across the consumer industry, and is aligned with our gallery strategy of fewer, more immersive and brand defining physical experiences. The introduction of our new RH Interiors Sourcebook is now planned to be in homes beginning early February with 89 new collections across furniture, upholstery, lighting, rugs and textiles. The new collections and improved in-stocks should further increase our vector and market share gains in the first half of 2025. The introduction of our 2025 RH Outdoor Sourcebook, featuring the most dominant assortment of high quality outdoor furniture in the world, is also planned for early February. The new sourcebook will include eight new outdoor furniture collections, an exciting new outdoor textiles offering, plus a significantly improved in-stock position to start the season versus a year ago. As you know, we acquired Waterworks in 2016, arguably the most desired brand in the luxury bath and kitchen category. The Waterworks team has done an outstanding job over the past eight years to further elevate the brand and build a highly profitable business model that can scale. Waterworks, like most other luxury brands in the home space, generates the vast majority of its revenues from the trade market, selling to architects, designers, developers and builders. While RH has a meaningful trade business, the vast majority of our revenue is generated by consumers. We believe there is a significant opportunity to amplify the Waterworks business on the RH platform by exposing the brand to a much larger audience, similar to how we have expanded other trade focused businesses and brands over the years. This week, we will begin to introduce the Waterworks brand across the RH platform beginning with a 3,000 square-foot Waterworks showroom in our largest new design gallery opening tomorrow in Newport Beach, California. Our interior designers around the world will now be able to specify Waterworks in their design projects and customers will be able to view and purchase Waterworks on rh.com in the next few weeks. We also plan to test a Waterworks sourcebook in the second half of 2025. Waterworks today is just shy of a $200 million business with mid to high teens EBITDA margin that we believe has the potential to become a billion-dollar global brand on our platform. We also have plans to unveil RH Couture Upholstery by Dmitriy & Co in the first half of 2025. We purchased Dmitriy & Co in 2020 with a vision of making the most exquisitely designed and crafted upholstered furniture in the world, previously only available to the trade, accessible to consumers on the RH platform. While there has been much speculation regarding how we might change Dmitriy & Co to address a larger market, our plan is just the opposite. We believe, by not changing anything, we will change everything. Like Waterworks, we believe transitioning some of the most admired brands in the world from a solely trade based to a blended consumer and trade-based business model is a very big idea and one that can result in exponential growth for these highly desired brands. Additionally, we plan to introduce a significant new brand extension in the fall of 2025 that we believe will meaningfully expand the market size and share of the RH brand. This new brand extension will include a new sourcebook and have a significant website presence on rh.com. We expect to present the product in our galleries in early 2026 and will share more details of this exciting new venture in the new year. Lastly, we do not expect a negative impact to margins as a result of the most recent communications regarding the potential for increased tariffs in 2025. We have been proactively moving sourcing away from China over the past several years with the expectation of fully exiting the country by the end of the second quarter. We are also transitioning products manufactured in Mexico and believe we can successfully reposition our sourcing with no disruption to the supply chain. Let me shift your attention to the elevation and expansion of our platform. We continue to open the most inspiring and immersive physical experiences in our industry, and some would say the world. Spaces that are a reflection of human design, a study of balance, symmetry, and perfect proportions; spaces that blur the lines between residential and retail, indoors and outdoors, home and hospitality; spaces with garden courtyards, rooftop restaurants, wine, and barista bars; spaces that activate all of the senses; and spaces that cannot be replicated online. Our plan to expand the RH brand globally, address new markets locally, and transform our North American galleries represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. Our platform expansion plan for the remainder of 2024 and 2025 includes RH Newport Beach, opening tomorrow with over 90,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space spread over four floors with views of the Pacific Ocean will be one of our most dramatic, immersive, and brand-defining physical experiences to date, and will replace three legacy galleries in the region. RH Newport Beach, the gallery at Fashion Island, features the RH Ocean Grill, a 270-seat indoor-outdoor rooftop restaurant with uninterrupted views and dramatic sunsets over the California coastline; two wine and barista bars; our first Waterworks showroom; an interior design atelier, and the most expansive luxury outdoor furniture assortment in our industry. We believe RH Newport Beach will be an inspiring destination in the Southern California market and has the potential to become our second $100 million-plus gallery. RH Montecito, also opening this week, is a reimagination of the historic fire house in the charming enclave perched above Santa Barbara. The Gallery will feature The RH Firehouse Grill, an indoor-outdoor courtyard restaurant with fireplaces and fountains, a wine and barista bar, plus an interior design atelier. The first RH Interior Design studio is opening this week in Palm Desert, California. Our goal is to establish RH as the leading interior design firm in the world, as we've moved the brand from simply curating and selling product, to conceptualizing and selling spaces. The Palm Desert location is a unique test of a consumer-facing interior design firm, not a gallery. Our theory is, by presenting RH Interior Design in a singular fashion as a professional interior design firm, we will attract the highest caliber interior designers, and therefore, the highest value consumers. We believe this might be one of the most important strategies to elevate and distinguish the RH brand as a global design authority at the highest end of the market. We are also developing an RH design ecosystem in Palm Desert with plans to add a 10,000-square-foot RH design gallery and a freestanding 5,000-square-foot RH outdoor furniture gallery on the same street. Additionally, we are considering a freestanding RH all-day cafe to complete the ecosystem in the near future. RH Raleigh opened in November of this year with 50,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space over three levels. The gallery includes a rooftop restaurant, garden courtyards, a wine and barista bar, and an interior design atelier. We plan to open seven North American Galleries in 2025 including Montreal, Manhasset, Detroit, Oklahoma City, Los Gatos, Palm Desert, and Aspen. Additionally, we plan to open two international galleries in 2025, RH Paris and RH London. We anticipate an inflection of our business in Europe as we begin to open in the important brand-building markets of Paris and London in 2025 and Milan in 2026. It is then we will gain scale to support the advertising investments necessary to build our business across Europe. We are pleased with the second-year growth trends at RH England as the gallery is up 42% July through December, while the web business is up 111%. Current demand trends would indicate the gallery would reach approximately $31 million in its second full year with the web demand reaching $7 million in its second full year. To put these results in the proper perspective, if an RH Gallery in the English countryside, with an estimated population of 100,000 in a 10-mile radius, almost two hours outside of London, can generate $38 million of demand in its second year, what can an RH Gallery in the center of Mayfair, the most exclusive district of London, a global city with a population of 9.7 million, do in its second year? We believe exponentially more. We are also making meaningful investments to elevate and differentiate our online experience with plans to upgrade our website in the fourth quarter of 2024 and throughout 2025. Some of the functionality we plan to introduce is quite revolutionary and unlike anything in the market. We plan to file for design patents on several of the user interface and presentation designs and will begin to discuss the new website strategy in more detail as we roll out the new functionality. Leaders have to be comfortable making others uncomfortable. Leadership is about pursuing a vision, leading people somewhere they've never been, doing things they've never done. As creatures of habit, change is uncomfortable for humans, but for the people and partners of Team RH, a culture of invention and innovation is at the core of who we are and reflected in everything we do. We've grown comfortable making ourselves and others uncomfortable for over two decades and plan to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. It's what leaders do, and how we know we're on the right path, whether it's investing in the most prolific product transformation in the history of our industry while others are hunkering down during the worst housing market in three decades, or opening the largest and most immersive physical retail experiences in the world while others are shrinking or closing their stores and moving online. By refusing to follow the herd into the anything but social, world of social media, you won't find us on Instagram, or paying strangers, influencers, to say they love our brand on TikTok, we chose to, in the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, \"Go instead where there is no path, and leave a trail\". We aim to craft our own unique identity, one built on a foundation of invention and innovation, truth and trust, taste and style, leadership and love. Over 20 years ago, we began this journey with a vision of transforming a nearly bankrupt business that had a $20 million market cap and a box of Oxydol laundry detergent on the cover of its catalog into the leading luxury home brand in the world. The lessons and learnings, the insights and intricacies, the sacrifices made and scar tissue developed by getting knocked down 10 times and getting up 11 leads to the development of the mental and moral qualities that build character in individuals and form cultures in organizations. Lessons that can't be learned in a classroom, or by managing a business, lessons that must be earned by building one. In a world that rewards duplication and penalizes the inherent bumpy road of innovation, especially for companies in the public domain, we, the people and partners of Team RH, will continue to drive ourselves to destroy today's reality so we can create tomorrow's future while remaining completely comfortable making ourselves and others uncomfortable. Never underestimate the power of a few good people who don't know what can't be done, especially these people. Onward, Team RH. Carpe diem. At this point, operator, we'll open the call to questions. Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser -- Analyst Good morning. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking my question. Your outperformance relative to the industry has obviously been very wide. So, how are you thinking about taking advantage of this, such that, would you further accelerate some of the investments that you're making in 2025? And if that were the case, would you be willing to trade some margins, so suppress margin, even if it meant that you were still accelerating your sales? Thank you so much. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, Michael, I think that's always a question for business leaders. And what is an investment cycle look like? What is the harvesting cycle look like? How are you thinking about the business long term versus short term? You know, I think it's an interesting time in our industry. There's multiple people pursuing different paths. Generally, a time like this is a hunkering down or harvesting time. People pull back investments. If you looked at our history, this has always been an investment period because the other side of that downturn in a housing market usually leads to the potential to gain significant market share on the other side. So, yes, as we look forward. I would say, today, the view would be most of the significant investments are behind us, you know, the early investments into Europe. Not that we don't have more, but the initial investments into Europe to just put in a platform to be able to launch a business there is pretty significant. We do have some, you know, significant investments with RH Paris and RH London and RH Milan. But most of that cash spend is behind us, right, even, you know, as we think of the investments we've made to transform the product over the last 24 months because the real effort began, you know, a couple of years ago. So, the ramping up and building the muscles that you need to operate at a level that we are operating at today is really behind us. If you think about the new significant brand extension we're discussing, most of that product is in the pipeline. I mean, we could technically launch it today. We're just kind of polishing it up. So, those investments are mostly behind us. But, you know, but our company is based on invention and innovation. It's based on investing into the future, and it's based on kind of, you know, an endless growth, if you will. So, you know, I wanted to think that that generally happens to retail brands over time. You know, I'd like to say that a retail mall is nothing but a graveyard for short-lived ideas. That's because, you know, most retailers open a new concept. They get enough right. They expand it. They don't evolve it. They don't innovate. They kind of get a model of we're going to open 20 of these a year, 40 of these a year. And pretty soon, you blink, and seven years goes by. And somebody has, you know, a range of 100 to 300 stores. And they're all kind of dated and they're all tired because there hasn't been a focus of invention and innovation. There's been a focus of rollout and duplication. And that's why most retail brands don't even last the full term of their lease. If you look at a retail mall and take a snapshot of it today and look back 10 years or look forward 10 years, about 65% of the retail mall evolved every 10 to 15 years or -- you know, and a lot of retailers don't make it to the term of the lease. So, you know, we're someone different in that nature, right? We've been on this journey -- you know, this is my 24th year, and we took a business that was basically a bankrupt business, and we had to kind of dig it out of the grave, right? So, we started underground, if you will, kind of dig our way out. And then, we've been building, and we've been kind of pursuing a path of a climb up the luxury mountain and try to build the luxury brand. And that's taken, yeah, considerable investment. But today, if you just, again, motor up and look at the platform we built and think about -- put the current numbers into context, right, you know, we have a lot of deleverage to our operating model because of significant investments we've made. All of the cash investments are behind us. And so, I look forward and I think about the cashflow over the next couple of years, and I see, you know, significantly increasing compounding cashflow model. I don't see really significant capital investments beyond the kind of iconic brand-building galleries. But even from that point of view, cash is mostly out the door in the company, you know, in Paris and London and so on and so forth. Some of it, you're going to have a drag on depreciation going forward because we've made a lot of investments. And that's, you know, why we think it's probably important as you think about our model looking forward to focus on adjusted EBITDA margin, right? Because that's going to be the -- adjusted EBITDA margin and kind of cash for generation, that's going to be the right way to look at a model like ours. You know, it's no different than, for how many years, Amazon had a depressed model because they were in a serious investment mode to build a platform nobody else has ever built. And you might never see it again. I believe that's relative to our story. You know, if you just go back over the last 10 or 12, 14 years and think about the investments we've made in our platform, think about the number of significant galleries we have that are unlike anything in our industry, nobody close. And think about, you know, what we've built over the last several years, think about the product transformation we've gone through and the investments that takes to build that, you know, the inventory investments it takes to, you know, to front-load a business like ours with inventory so you can add the inventory to create an inflection, right? And then, think about the inventory that you have to kind of invest into to kind of bridge from where you were to where you are so you don't create a ditch as you transition from current product to new product. All of that is a serious investment cycle and, you know, somewhat distorts the short-term view of our model. I think if you take the vector, which is, you know, significantly increasing, right, in magnitude and direction, and you just kind of chart out that vector over time. And you think about a significant amount of an investment cycle kind of being behind us, you could plot out what this model might look like over the next two, three, four, five years. And then, if you compound out with an accelerating housing market, which it will come, right? I mean, it's the most depressed housing market any of us have seen in the history of our experience, and you have to kind of appreciate the position we're in today as you look out over the next five years. Michael Lasser -- Analyst Got you. Very helpful. And my follow-up question is, as we look out over the next couple of years, A, should we think -- is your baseline assumption that as the housing market does improve, it will lead to an acceleration in the recent trajectory of the business that you've seen so we should think about that as we start to model next year and beyond? And B, given the pacing of margin decline that RH has experienced over the last couple of years of sales have been under pressure, is that the right frame of reference to think about how margins will recover that the same degree of sharpness as the pace of sales growth maintains like you've seen it recently? Thank you. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I think that's directionally marked, right? I mean, the question is, what is the housing market worth? It's not only worth 5% when it comes back. It's likely worth 30%, right? And, you know, that'll kind of compound over a couple of years. It might start out worth 10, and it compounds to, you know, 15. But it might just spike, and you might see the housing market come back, right? You might see 30% growth. You could see 50% growth. If you think about how depressed it's been for how long, you think about that built-up potential demand and how many people have wanted to move for several years, you know, expanding families, people relocating, turning into renters, and so on and so forth because of the, you know, significant gap between interest rates, right, and how many people are locked into low interest rates. So, that's going to evolve, that's going to change, you know, exactly when it happens. We're kind of ambivalent about that. Quite frankly, sometimes, I talk internally about, \"Hey, I hope the housing market stays flat for another year.\" We'll have a lot less competitors if it does. We'll gain a lot more market share if it does. So, I'm not necessarily enthusiastic about when the housing market comes back because a bad housing market for a brand like ours positioned the way it is is actually kind of a good thing if you think about what the future will look like, because a lot of the ankle biters that were able to, you know, raise capital easily, you know, the last five, 10 years and especially, you know, pre-COVID, five years before COVID and, you know, the four, five years after COVID, I mean, everything in the home business was looking great, and you could raise capital really easy. And someone could start an online brand, and all that is some level of competition. There's just more places to shop. There's more people marketing. There's more people, you know, on Instagram marketing or online marketing and so on and so forth. And there's been a proliferation of competitors in the housing market. You see that now shrinking very quickly. You know, there's been a lot of public bankruptcies or, you know, I'd say almost bankrupt or kind of bankrupt and bought out of bankruptcy because there's a couple of online aggregators. I can't remember the name of one of the brands that's bought a bunch of them. I probably don't need to say it anyway. You guys probably know who they are. Yeah, but, you know, kind of Gavin Grover, our, you know, lead outside counsel, he says, you know, \"Two drunk people, you know, leaning against the bar doesn't create a better situation.\" You know, so you take kind of multiple bad brands and put it together and you hope for leverage through that aggregation is -- it usually doesn't work. I mean, look at the recent situation with, you know, that Overstock.com and Bed Bath & Beyond. I mean, anybody betting on that marriage. I think, is going to, you know, look good over the long term. Yeah, so, you know, we would think that, yes, there's so many levels of opportunity. There's the housing market. There's the housing market stays down. There's going to be more people struggling in our market, you know, the furniture-based home furnishings market. And there's going to be more opportunity on the other side. I mean, our inflection is happening regardless, right? So, you know, ask yourself, when is the last time a brand of our size and scale in a mature market has created a market share, a share lead of more than five points or 10 points? You know, five points would be considered really good. Ten points would be considered outstanding. What is 25 to 45 points look like? Track that out over the next few years. You know, that can completely change everything. Michael Lasser -- Analyst Thank you very much, and have a good holiday. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, you too. The next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Christopher Horvers -- Analyst Thanks, good evening, everybody. So, I'll keep my question to a two-parter. The first question is, as your guiding the fourth quarter below what you're seeing quarter to date, is that just caution on your behalf? Is there some sort of seasonality of the business to think about proceeding through the quarter? And then, the second part is you've put a lot of clearance in the past few years to introduce all of this newness, 80% newness this year. Is it your expectation that over time that you can get that clearance margin back? Thanks very much. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good question. The guide is, we think, is kind of a correct guide. It depends on what -- you know, how the rest of December and January plays out. So, 75 percent roughly of our business, the balance is between 73 and 76, I think, is our kind of core RH brand if you think about it. And then we have another, you know, quarter of our business that are other things like contract, outlet, baby and child, teen, Waterworks, Dmitriy, etc. And if you just kind of pull back and think about the -- you know, those businesses are not accelerating like the core brand, right? Kind of outlined in the letter that those should accelerate, many of them. You know, obviously Waterworks won't be impacted by our product transformation, but, you know, our platform will enable the Waterworks brand, too, do some things that they might not have been able to do in the past. No different than, you know, other -- you know, how we scaled other businesses. But, but the markdown percentage, if you looked at the history of our business and our core business, would say the amount we have on markdowns. Like today, if you look at it, 75% of our -- today, if you look at it, about 80% of our business in the third quarter is at full price -- with a full price, and about 20% is on a markdown. It will fluctuate 2022, you know, 78-22, 80-20. Over the years, like in a really up housing market, that could be as low as 90-10, but there's always a percentage of clearance. I would say, our competitive set, or just the general industry as a whole, would love to have an 80-20 mix, right, love to have an 80-20 mix. Is the clearance part of the business may be more under pressure than it would be in a good housing market? Sure. You know, is the clearance part of the business going to be bigger during a bad housing market? Of course, it is. Those are all firm grasp of the obvious, right? But the other thing we're doing is, you know, if you read my letter, you know, you hear me talk about the disruptive nature of our brand, and you've seen us kind of move in the past couple of years into much more of an attack mode. And, you know, we think that there is an ability to take more oxygen out of the room, if you will by playing the game that we're playing right now. And it's not necessarily -- it's a clearance game, but it's a design quality value game. It's, you know, looking at, you know, disrupting the market from a design point of view, a quality point of view, and a value point of view. And I think that's what we're doing today. So, you know, maybe that's putting a little bit of pressure on margin initially. But as you grow like we are, there's inherent efficiencies and scale, right?So, if you think about the demand trends we have today, if you think about us ordering back into products, if you think about the leverage that we're going to get and our partners -- manufacturing partners are going to get and what the future orders might look like, those could be at higher margins, right? But taking the market share, taking the oxygen out of the room, creating leverage in the business model from the top line point of view, you know, putting the investments in place, and then continuing to expand margin, you know, through the leverage you get throughout the platform -- and when I say the platform, I also am talking about our manufacturing platform, our vendor partners. We do own some of our own manufacturing. We have a factory in North Carolina, upholstery and stuff, etc. But mostly, we don't own the manufacturing platform. But if you're a partner of ours, you know, we talk about and we interface with our partners like we're one company. And we talk about where is there leverage, where scale can create, you know, better margin, you know, better pricing, more disruptive pricing, and so on and so forth. I think, right now, it is a better time to invest in disruptive pricing and disable competitors than it is to harvest the business and take lower sales. You know, different people are taking different paths. Some people are taking -- you know, giving up market share, you know, not trying to take market share, and they're harvesting, right, and expanding operating margin and margins right now. We could do that, too. We could do that, too. I'd rather be trending up 30% in my core RH business than down 3% or 5% giving up share during this time. There will be lots of leverage on the other side of running up 30. In fact, it will -- lots of leverage and a significantly stronger market position. Christopher Horvers -- Analyst Thank you so much. Have a great holiday. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator The next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Zach Abraham -- Analyst Hi. This is Zach on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our question. Following up on some of the free cashflow commentary earlier, can you speak to when you expect RH to turn free cashflow positive? And as follow-up, how do you think about the funding needs of the business and whether it can be self-funded? Thank you. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, we believe next year will turn free cash flow positive and we'll, you know, be able to self-fund the business. I mean, you know, the significant part of our debt is, you know, we don't really think about it as debt, right? We think about it more as a currency swap, right? If you look at our debt independently, you can say, \"Oh, they have a lot of debt.\" We look at it somewhat differently. We think of it as the currency swap. One, we didn't spend the money. We didn't buy anything. We didn't buy any physical assets. We didn't buy any buildings with our debt. You know, we didn't build any distribution centers with our debt. We exchanged one-currency debt for what we believe is an exponentially more valuable currency, our stock, which is a highly liquid currency, right? We can turn our stock into cash tomorrow. So, you know, we took on debt, we exchanged that currency for our stock. You know, today, you know, post the interest costs on the debt, you know, we've turned a $2.25 billion investment into -- you know, significantly, we've made several hundred million dollars on that investment already based on the closing price of our stock today. I mean, if you look at where stocks trading after hours, that investment looks significantly bigger, right? So, you know, our baseline, you know, our business trends and an expected return to growth in the housing market, that return, we believe, will grow exponentially, right? But, you know, we don't -- we don't have debt on our balance sheet because we needed cash. We have a meaningful part of debt on our balance sheet because we wanted to do a currency exchange. We wanted to purchase our stock when it was undervalued. I think we bought 7.6 million shares at an average price of 295. I don't know, where's the stock after hours right now? Is it four something? Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I think it's at 450 last I saw it. Allison Malkin -- Investor Relations Four hundred fifty-one. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, 452. So, that's a pretty good return that we -- and what would that return be? I mean, what -- what's our cost of capital over that period, 100 and something -- Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer Three hundred fifty, 350 million today. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, it's about $350 million return. So, look, we've done this before. This is not the first time we've done this. If you look at our history, we have taken debt, exchanged it for our stock, and created significant value for shareholders. I'm the largest single shareholder in the company. That's the way I think about it. Zach Abraham -- Analyst Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Steven Zaccone with Citi. Your line is open. Steve Zaccone -- Analyst All right. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the accelerated momentum. I was curious, Gary, if you could just help us understand the drivers of really the acceleration in the business. You know, what's really changed with the product? How do you feel about your competitive positioning? Why do you think you're outperforming the industry by such a wide margin? And then, if the industry comes back stronger in '25, do you think you're well-positioned to scale and fulfill that higher demand? Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, I think everything that we believe is in the letter. I don't know if there's a lot more to say than, you know, what in the letter or what I might have commented on that's far why we think we're outperforming. I mean, it's -- you know, we have a lot of competitive advantages. We have a platform that, you know, significantly we believe better than anybody else in the industry. We have, you know, product capabilities, you know, savvy, you know, taste that we believe better than anybody in the industry. I've said it before, there are those with taste in those scale and those with scale and no taste, and we believe the idea of scaling taste is large and far reaching. So, that's what we're doing. We believe our taste level, you know, demonstrated not only through the product, but demonstrated through the, you know, galleries we built the physical, you know, aspects of our business, our sourcebooks, our website, and so on, and so forth. You know, we believe we're building a platform for taste that's going to be highly disruptive and lucrative over the long run. And that's, you know, that's taste level and, you know, the capabilities we have at scaling taste, you know, our ability to curate -- our ability, you know, curate product, our ability to integrate product. And our ability to present product better than anyone in the world, I think, is demonstrated based on the size and scale and profitability of our business thus far. And we'll continue to create strategic separation as we go forward. So, that's who we are at our core, right? That's what we do. That's what we've spent 24 years building. And you haven't seen our center of innovation and product leadership. You know, anybody on the call, I recommend, you know, try to schedule a visit because nobody has anything like it. You know, that has been built. It's a huge competitive advantage. Our methodology is the way we think about the business, the way we strategically think about categories, the way we strategically integrate categories into a singular and focused point of view that breaks through the clutter in the market. All of those are reasons why we're outperforming. So, you know, look, we -- you know, I've talked about the strategic mistake I made when I turned off the product engine during COVID because, you know, we couldn't get the goods. You know, when we cut orders in the beginning of COVID, you know, the business went down 40 percent, then the business went from down 40 percent to up 40 percent, moved 80 points just as we cut orders. You know, factories were shutting down and so forth, and we had a hard time getting products. I said let's shut off the product engine for a year. Then omicron hit, and you had another cycle of COVID. And so, the product engine was off for two years. And then, we tried to turn the product engine back on. We had kind of lost our muscle memory, and we executed poorly in that third year. So, you know, now everybody's competing against not only kind of who we were, but we built ourselves into a better version of ourselves. And so, you know, that's why -- I mean, we didn't mail our core books for three years. So, everybody thought that they were doing so well with RH on the sidelines don't feel so good today. And now, well, we're back to playing our games, but in a very evolved way. I think we're smarter than we've ever been. We're more driven and determined than we've ever been. We're more creative, curious, and critical than we've ever been. And I think the next five years for this company is going to be the best five years in the history of this company. And I think five years from now, we'll be better than we are today. So, it's just who we are at our core. You know, innovation is at the core of what we do. Steve Zaccone -- Analyst Understood. The follow-up I had is just on gross margin. When you reported the last quarter, you talked about August seeing a positive inflection in product margin. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Steve Zaccone -- Analyst How did that play out over the balance of the quarter? And maybe how should we think about product margin in the fourth quarter? Thanks very much. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, product margin at the demand level is still positive. We did have, you know, some adjustments below the selling margin. You know, one of them was in market stock. I think we did such big transformations of our galleries that we had some bigger market stock. When you ship our product outside of the box, it's not generally a good thing. And so, you know, we took a -- when we do a floor set transformation, we take the product off the floor. You know, we have teams that are local home delivery networks that pick up all that product. The product's not new, it's not in the box, not in the protected packaging. They take it back, and then it gets fed to the outlets. And we've never made a transformation this large. And I think we probably, you know, had more damages and more things, you know, that got banged up moving back and forth in trucks and moving around without boxes. And so, we had to take some write-offs for product that we thought, you know, wasn't really sellable at the outlet level. Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer Plus elevated cost of moving the product and elevated inventory transfer costs. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Yeah, go ahead, Jack. Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, one-time inventory transfer costs, too, related to moving that product. We also just rebalanced some product in our DCs just to get it optimally positioned, so -- Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, this will also move the product from Europe -- Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer From Europe. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer From Europe back to America. We didn't start off with picking all the right products when we filled the DC in Europe. And now, we see the trends and we realized, \"Oh, gosh, so we got too much of this, too much of that.\" Well, instead of marking down all that product in Europe, it's better for us to just ship it back to Baltimore, you know, feed the core business. So, we do that. That's another one-time kind of charge. So -- but at a general selling level, especially in our core business, you know, we liked how our margins are trending. We think there's going to be, you know, upward opportunity and margins, not downward pressure and margins looking forward. Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer And Gary said on demand margin basis, but it's also on a ship margin basis. The selling margins on the ship basis in the quarter were inflected positive. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Steve Zaccone -- Analyst OK, very helpful. Thanks, guys. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Great. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Steven Forbes -- Analyst Good evening, Gary, Jack. Gary, maybe just a two-part question on real estate, given sort of the planned -- the sheer number of openings, right, planned over the next couple of years here. So, to start, can you speak to maybe the performance payback periods and store-level ROICs that you're sort of expecting in these classes of galleries maybe relative to what you've spoken to in the past? And then, how have the discussions with landlords and developers evolved over the past couple of years? Maybe have you seen, you know, cost pressures normalize in the uniqueness of your model and just the pipeline itself? How has the conversation with landlords and developers evolved? Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So, yeah, let's start with the payback and ROICs. You know, historically, we've always said payback of, I think, one to three years. We believe that's still the right number. Where it wasn't the right number was anything built during COVID, right? Because things that's being built during COVID stopped and started three or four times, and you had raw material costs in some places go up two to three times or 4x. So, anything built during COVID was significantly more expensive, you know, up to three times more. I'd say in a general sense, building costs today to build at any level, no matter if you're in retail or any kind of business, are somewhere between 70% and 100% higher. So, it costs us more to build the gallery today than it did. The good news is we have a significant inflection in our demand and our sales, and we have an expectation for returning housing market lift. But in most of the galleries, I'd say, in the pipeline today that we're opening will be relatively quick paybacks. Maybe the really iconic ones, like London, you know, and Paris, might take three or four years, but they might take two years. For example, RH Newport Beach is a good example. We have a developer and a partner there in the Irvine company. I think they cleared about eight retailers for us, right? So, if you think about the investment, you know, that a developer partner would make here, they cleared probably eight retailers, took dead rent for several years because our projects take anywhere from two to three years. It takes a long time to get approvals and, you know, build these kind of buildings. So, they cleared rent for several years. They completely cleared the site, ripped down two- or three-story buildings, you know, to clear the site and make it construction-ready for us. And they invested $25 million, right? We got -- in TI. We probably invested in that one an additional 50 to 60. You know, directionally, we're still adding it all up. We had a bit of a chaos just trying to get it open for the opening party because these things are big and complex. But that gallery will likely pay back in -- from our cash point of view, in one year, maybe one and a half. And so --but you have other ones that, the ones in Europe there's not a lot of TI. You know, they're street locations. So, there's a, you know, somewhat bigger investment, and we'll see how the revenues are. London does what we think it's going to be. Maybe it's a two-year payback. It could be a three-year payback. But three-year paybacks on iconic brand-defining locations that you're going to control for the next 40 years is the right thing to do, right? And the other thing I'd say is, think about how many of these big galleries we already have out there that we now built for half of the price of what it costs today. You know, I think it's going to be really hard for anyone to try to duplicate our physical platform. Almost impossible, I would say. You know, you'd have to have the revenues that we generate, and then you'd have to be willing to pay multiple times what we pay for the vast majority of our platform, right? So -- but I think one of the key issue that we've talked about internally, and how do we create the right lens for investors looking forward is, you know, we do have increased depreciation, and we will have increased depreciation. Yeah, so if you look at us at an operating margin point of view, you could say, \"Oh, there's pressure on operating margin because of more depreciation.\" Well, that's true, we've spent that money. And we have a little bit more that's kind of coming through with Paris and London, as we -- you know, as they come on. But they -- they're going to come on more from a depreciation point of view, not from a cash point of view, if that makes sense. So, when I look at the business, again, as the company's largest shareholder, I'm thinking about what are the long-term cash returns look like. You know, and I'd say to myself is operating margin the right lens? Probably not. You know, adjusted EBITDA is probably the right lens. Cash flow generation over the next five years is probably the right lens. But the headline on gallery paybacks going forward, I'd say one to three years. A lot of the ones that are in the pipeline today, yes, some will be one year, one and a half years. You know, London and Paris might be three, something like that, might be two. All depends what we come out. I think that the math I tried to lay out in the letter about, you know, RH England, right? It's two hours outside of London, it's got a population in a 10-mile radius of 100,000 people. There's not a lot of cars that drive by the gallery. And it's still trending. You know, we take galleries in our business to do somewhat like $38 million. If we can generate, you know, $35 million to $40 million, two hours outside of London, you know, where 10 miles -- in a 10-mile radius, there's like 100,000 people, what can we generate in Mayfair in the absolute bullseye of London where there's 9.7 million people? Like you got to take some multiple, right? Is it a 3x, is it a 5x? Is it -- you know, it's not 50% more. So, in looking at the numbers that way, we're highly optimistic about Europe and, you know, some of those things. And we're probably -- based on what we think will happen, and even in Europe, we'll be a much more desirable tenant especially when we're not buying a building. But landlord discussions, how they've evolved over the, you know, past few years. You know, landlords are doing, \"Hey, how are you performing? What's your market cap look like?\" All those kinds of things. As our performance is better, as our margins are better, as our stock price is higher, we become more attractive to landlords because we'll probably have a better credit rating. Their properties are going to get a lower cap rate. And, you know, that's why we've been able to do what we've been able to do over the past 15 years in building this platform. So, right now, people are really excited to talk about developing with us again. Today, we're getting three times the inbound. And I think that that's only going to increase. So, our optionality is going to be better. But you still do right now, there's a bigger cost for buildings because debt is higher, you know, etc. So -- but the outlook should be great. There'll be a lot of optionality ahead of us. At the same time, we don't want to get oversaturated, and we don't want to create a whole bunch of cannibalization. You know, we think it's better to have fewer, more iconic locations, than to just kind of cover the market in an ordinary way. So, we'll continue to be very selective in what we're doing, but we do have different vehicles now. You know, we have -- we'll see how this test goes with the first freestanding design studio, which is not a design studio like we built in the past, because we've built things that we call design studios, they're really small stores, right? These are actual interior design offices, consumer-facing, which there are none in the world, right? Interior designers don't have consumer-facing offices. We do. I mean, just as a point of reference on that point, I think -- which is interesting, because I think this is going to be more important than we think. When we open a gallery, and, you know, we look at applications for interior designers, we might get six to 12 interior design applications. For our freestanding interior design office, we got 200 to 300 applications. And our theory was, you know, a lot of interior designers don't want to work in a retail store. And we're thinking we're changing that in our current retail stores because we're creating separate, you know, design offices that are kind of walled off with glasses and so on and so forth. But still, you know, so you may -- depending on how that happens, you know, the response we've had, and then just the response we've had from people trying to come in, consumers trying to come in and access us, we'll learn a lot more starting next week. But, you know, there's going to be lots more opportunities. And then, also, as our volumes build, the more we do in volume opens up more opportunities in more markets. So, if you thought about, you know, five years ago, we did X in a market, or we thought we were going to do an X in a market. But now, we look at a market and we can do 1.5x, all of a sudden the real estate deals look completely different, and the number of markets look completely different, right? And so, that's where, you know, that could change. We think we could have 60 to 70 galleries, you know, bigger-size galleries, 50 or 60, whatever the range is. And all of a sudden you're doing 50% more volume in a three, four, or five years from now. All of a sudden you probably have an additional 30 markets you can open because there's places you thought you could only do, 20 million in. And now, you can do, you know, 30 million in, and it changes the economic model. So, I think people are pretty excited about RH today. I think they'll be even more excited after they, you know, digest our numbers from today and think about where we're going. And, you know, we've become like a preferred anchor. Like if you look at what we're going to do in Naples, we're taking a Nordstrom's location, and we're building one of our first RH compounds. I don't know if I've even talked about an RH compound yet. No? You'll hear more about it. And maybe I have, I can't remember. But anyway, it's a whole new kind of RH shopping experience, multi-building connected with courtyards and walkways. And it's like nothing else anybody's ever seen. But it's a way to take a big site, cover the site in a really exciting way and probably spend a third less capital. And then, you know, there's another RH compound coming in Walnut Creek where we're taking a Neiman Marcus location. And I think when the landlord community sees -- you know, the developer community sees the new compounds, I think people are going to like that, too. So, we're really excited about looking out at openings and, you know, the physical expansion of the brand, but we want to be cautious not to get oversaturated, not to create too much cannibalization. Steven Forbes -- Analyst Thank you, Gary. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Steve. Operator The next question comes from Max Rakhlenko with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Max Rakhlenko -- Analyst Great. Thanks a lot, and congrats on all the progress. So, first, just what inning of the product transformation cycle would you say you're in now? And that's both the product itself, as well as the gallery [Inaudible] Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer What inning? You know, I would have said maybe the sixth inning, you know, before my latest trip to Asia and Vietnam. And now, I'd say we might be in the fourth inning because the dots have, you know, continued to connect. And so, we'll -- there's a lot in the pipeline. There's just a lot in the pipeline. I mean, again, if you read the letter, there's a lot happening, a lot coming. The significant brand extension I'm talking about might be worth as much as everything that we just did. So, I mean, I think it could be massively, massively accretive. And so, yeah, we still call it maybe the fourth or fifth, fourth inning halfway. But again, that always changes, right, as you evolve because you connect that dot, you see more, so on and so forth. I think it's like -- I don't mean to sound arrogant and compare ourselves to Apple, right, but at what point, you know, someone would ask Steve Jobs when they introduced the first Apple phone, and he said, \"This is going to change everything,\" what inning were they in? You know, I mean, what was their market cap then after the first year of the iPhone or second year of the iPhone? Maybe 500 million, something like that, maybe 400 billion, 300 billion. I don't know what Apple's worth today, 2.5 trillion, right? Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, around that. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, 3 trillion, something like that. So, the more you do, the more you see. You know, the more you see, the more you can do. And you go into what I refer to internally as an upward spiral. And I'd say today, we are in an upward spiral. We're doing more, we're seeing more, therefore, we're doing more and seeing more. And you go through that cycle. You can keep connecting dots and see more. So, that's why I say competitors, anybody who's hunkering down or trying to harvest in the harvest mode or they're trying to squeak out every, you know, tap point they can out of an operating model, that's the very temporal condition. We're in a real upward spiral here that it just going to lead to more and more. You know, so, you'll keep asking me what inning you're in, and I might be perpetually in the third to fifth innings. Max Rakhlenko -- Analyst I'll keep that in mind. And then, just thinking about some of your comments previously about harvesting profits down the road on the investments that you're making or you've made in the past, you know, how are you just thinking about the magnitude and where margins can go a couple of years from now? Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Nothing different than when we've always thought about it. You know, we're always going to be at some level of an investment stage. That's what you do if, you know, you're a brand that's based in, you know, invention and innovation. So -- but I'd say the phase we just went in was a pretty massive investment cycle, not just to scale up and ramp all the product that we have and build the pipeline and, you know, so on and so forth and, you know, build the organization to do that and the new partnerships to do that, but also, you know, launching Europe, right? I mean, that's a big kind of one-time investment you're making. And so some of that is behind us, yes, still up here, some of it's in front of us. But, once we build the platform in Europe, and once we kind of get the brand going. Look, if we were in year two, and, yeah, we were cycling RH England, and we were doing like $8 million, like, I'd be really worried. But when I sit there and I go like, \"OK, we're -- demand tracking it, 35 million to 40 million, somewhere around, you think net 38, something like that, and turn that into revenue, you're 32 million, something like that, 33 million, and then you say, I don't know, what's lending going to be with 9.7 million people in the heart of Mayfair. If you said it three times that, which I think could be conservative, that's $100 million in revenue. It's four times that or five times that that's $130 million to $160 million in revenue. And that's -- by the way, this is with the brand relatively unknown. And we went into an unknown place where the only retailer of our kind, for like, you know, I don't know, 100 miles, I guess I'd go like, it's a long way to anything like that. So, it's -- I think, you know, margins are where we think the margin model ought to be on a regular basis going forward. I mean, we're also in the depths of a bad housing market. If somebody said, \"Oh, well, homes increased 3%, right?\" That's a dead cap bounce. The housing market has not shifted yet, it's not meaningfully growing yet. And when it does, you know, we'll benefit from it, and you'll start to also see where the margin model will be. But right now, if you're looking at a margin model, you're looking at a margin model based on a bad housing market and a significant investment cycle. Maybe the biggest investment cycle. It's actually absolutely the biggest investment cycle we've ever been in, right? So, you're probably looking at kind of bottom margins for us. Max Rakhlenko -- Analyst Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. And enjoy Montecito. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. Sorry, you'll miss your first opening, Max. Operator The next question comes from Curt Nagle with Bank of America. Your line is open. Curtis Nagle -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much for taking it. Just a couple of ones. One, in terms of just thinking about demand and the revenue trends, you know, when should these equalize? When should the gap narrow? And maybe more specifically, looking at the first half of '25, you know, should we hold it something similar to what we're seeing in 4Q? Is that roughly the right math? And I'll follow up after that. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer That's a good question. I think it's going to -- yeah, it's going to start to narrow, and stocks are getting better. Yeah, we invested in more inventory to kind of close that gap. And so I think it'll be a little bumpy for a while until -- again, until the inflection of new product, you know, slows down a little bit. But we'll have a stronger point of view in the next quarter or two. But clearly, we see the gap shrinking. The end stocks are going up. But there's a whole new cycle of newness coming that, you know, could -- you could have some real runaways that, you know, create really high back stocks and, you know, longer lead times and so on and so forth. So, but the initial gap is closing, , you know, could be a -- could get a little wider and bounce around a bit. But I mean, directionally, I don't see it going back to as big as it was in the beginning of the transition. Curtis Nagle -- Analyst Got it. That would be, I guess, a high-class problem. That does happen. The second one, I guess, Gary, for you, just trying to think through, you know, very early stages here, but potential demand synergies for the core product in the trade business with this acceleration and, you know, expansion of the Waterworks business, which I think, as you said, is -- has a strong core, you know, B2B customer base. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Yeah. I think, well, one, the contract side of our business start there, you know, almost can't benefit from the new product yet because we're still getting in stock in the best product. And we still are building inventory to get into -- to transform the galleries. I mean, some of the newest product is coming out and outperforming, you know, the phase 1 products, right? So, we're going to have to transition galleries again to get the best product, which is, again, part of an upward spiral. So, I'd say the galleries today are a third right. I think there's two more transitions in the gallery to kind of optimize that, which, that means it's going to take a while for the best product to be available to the contract business. You know, I think that's what you mean by the trade business, but maybe I've got it wrong. And then, you know, Waterworks, you know, just having a just higher exposure and our interior designers being able to spec it across their projects and our customers being able to see it on our website, see it in a sourcebook, you know, just the brand recognition and awareness of Waterworks is going to grow, and the accessibility is going to grow. So, you know, we think that's going to be a big idea. How big could it be? We think it looks like a billion-dollar idea to us when we kind of track it out. So, the synergies and then just taking the best designs and translating those into smaller sizes for baby and child, and teen is going to be a real synergy. And, you know, as much as retailers don't like returns, returns are what drive the outlet business. The outlet business is dragged behind the core business significantly, right? Because there's not enough returns of the new product yet, which will drive that. So, again, it's all part of an upward spiral, right? And one begets the other. And, you know, all of the learnings right now, all of the things we're seeing, all of the dots we can now connect because there's a whole new set of data that we haven't had. And so, the data becomes richer, you know, you become smarter, you start investing wiser. Your next ideas are likely better than your last ideas because you're more informed. You have more knowledge. You're making better decisions, assessing things more correctly. So, I don't know if that answers your question or not. Curtis Nagle -- Analyst No, that's very clear, and I appreciate it, Gary. Happy holidays. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Great. Thank you. Thank you, Curtis. Operator The next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham -- Analyst Thanks a lot, and good afternoon. My question is just regarding the product transformation and what you characterize it for as inflection. You previously talked to a peak inflection point sometime in early 2025. So, this upward spiral that you're seeing right now, would you think that peak inflection is extended outwards? Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Massively outwards. Yeah, because when I talk about the peak inflection, like think about what I knew. Almost nothing, right? We had new products hitting. We saw trends on any product. We're tracking it out. What does it look like? But we didn't have enough data and information to really know any more than we knew. So, it got worse. Peak inflection now based on what we know, I think, is several years out. Seth Basham -- Analyst And previously, you talked about peak inflection being sort of the strongest year-over-year growth. I assume you're not thinking that strongest year-over-year growth is going to be a few years out, but you think that you'll see strong growth for the next few years, in other words. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think the strongest growth might be a year or two out because the significant brand extension I talked about is significant. It's not small. It's meaningful. And the amount of new product that's coming -- for example, a year ago, probably a year into this transformation, I kind of reframed everything for our internal team and our external partners. I said, \"Look, we are still in the early stages of what I called a product development super cycle.\" Something we've never done. Because we haven't enough data to say, like, this can be much bigger. We think about the market completely differently. We think about the size of the market, the consumer. We see more consumers. We see more homes. We see more rooms. We see more aesthetics. We see a significantly bigger opportunity for RH. In some ways, I'd say the classical way to think about us is kind of as a specialty brand, right, with a certain point of view. And that's how I'd probably say I looked at us over the last 20 years. How do we build this specialty brand with a certain aesthetic point of view and grow this brand? I think about us differently today. And I think about us a lot differently just in the last 45 days. I just haven't articulated it completely and clearly based on what we've learned. And it is directionally what we've framed over the last five years, right, with our long-term business vision and ecosystem. We've said there are those with taste and no scale. And those with scale and no taste. And the idea of scaling taste is large and far-reaching. So -- and then, we've articulated, right, what I call the one-pager, kind of a bigger view of how that can play. I think what the nuance is, is now, I'm beginning to see us and the team, you know, beginning to see us as maybe a platform for taste. Not just a brand. So, you think about -- I don't know, think about platforms or marketplaces. I mean, Wayfair is a marketplace. You know, somewhat, is it a brand? Of course. It's recognized for certain things and so on and so forth. But they don't really -- you know, it's not their product. It's available everywhere else. There's nothing unique about the product in Wayfair. But it is a platform and marketplace, you know, that's driving $12 billion of revenue, some number like that, right? And not all furniture, they sell lots of things. But if you start to say, can you transition the thinking about RH from just a classic way to think about a specialty brand and think about RH as a platform for taste and think about how you could dimensionalize taste across multiple aesthetics, across different life stages, across different kinds of homes, and so on and so forth, that, to us, that looks multiple times bigger potentially than I thought we could be. And, you know, we're still kind of shaping that thinking. But some of it we can see relatively clearly today. And that's why I think the growth trajectory or the vector may continue longer than we think. And we may think, you know, you're running the core businesses trending at 25 to 30 up, right? Well, you're going to come up to 25 to 30, are you going to grow 8 or 10 on top of that? I don't know. Can we grow 30 or 40 on top of that? It's not impossible based on what we see today. I don't want to -- I'm not promising anything. I'm not trying to give any kind of guidance. I'm just trying to kind of share with you directly how we're thinking and what we see. Again, the more we do, the more we see. The more we see, the more we can do. And we see a lot more than we've ever seen right now because of the product transformation and the product development super cycle. And the things we're doing and the dots we're connecting. And so, I think this upward spiral that we're in can be exponentially bigger and last significantly longer than if you would have asked me a couple of months ago. Seth Basham -- Analyst Wonderful. And just last follow-up. So, I know you'll provide more information next year, but this significant brand extension that you think could be worth over a billion dollars, is it within furniture or is it more adjacent beyond furniture? Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No, it's just kind of within the same thing we're doing. It's just unique, different, aesthetically different, and probably addresses the biggest part of the market. So -- and we think it's going to be amplified by what we think is a trend that is coming. Seth Basham -- Analyst Wonderful. Can't wait. Thanks a lot, Gary. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. Thank you, Seth. Operator The next question comes from Andrew Carter with Stifel. Your line is open. Andrew Carter -- Analyst Hey, thank you. Good evening. I just wanted to ask about the inventory, kind of going up again and again this quarter, the purchase is up 30%. Could you talk through kind of what kind of inefficiencies are in there? Is there some planning around there? I know that you're exiting China. Is there any safety stock in there for that, already contemplating that and you're exiting Mexico. And on those two points, correct me if I'm wrong, China was 22% of your purchase dollars last year. I don't know if you ever disclosed Mexico. Where is that going in terms of -- thanks. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, the first part of everything you said, I'd say correct. That would be my answer. The last part, you know, where's that going? I think we've said where we're going in China. It all depends what's happening in Mexico. Look, Donald Trump wrote \"The Art of the Deal,\" right? And if you've ever read \"The Art of the Deal,\" you -- if you do, you will see the negotiating starting to play out. There -- it is a global negotiation happening right now. Where will Mexico -- what will happen with Mexican tariffs? What moves should we make proactively? We're making some moves proactively, but I think Mexico is making moves. You're already hearing from inside sources that they're moving troops to the border. You know, they're going to try to take more responsibility for immigration. And if I was the president of Mexico, I sure would because I wouldn't want the biggest economy of the world to cut me off from trade. So, you know, Mexico, I think, is a little different than China, right? Mexico is not going to become the next global superpower that has a military that can threaten the United States. China can, right? So, if you think about why our country has never been attacked besides 9/11, which is basically some terrorists boarding our own planes and flying them into our buildings, that's a very unique attack. There hasn't been a military that has attacked the United States internationally on our home ground. Since when? Andrew Carter -- Analyst 1812? Yeah. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, yeah. Exactly. Why? Because we have the strongest military and nuclear arsenal in the world. So, I mean, look, Donald Trump is a great negotiator. I think he's looking at the world's playing field and saying, how do you use leverage? Negotiation without leverage is impersonation. And you better hope that they don't find out you're not who you are. So, he's really good at using leverage. He's done it before. We're seeing him do it now. He hasn't even taken office, and the art of the deal is in full play right now. It's actually quite impressive, I would say. And so, how is Mexico going to play out? I don't think -- if you're Mexico, you do not want that faucet turned off. You don't want 25% tariffs. I'm not saying it's not going to happen. It may happen, it may happen for a while. I think we have too much leverage there. China is a whole different story. It's a whole different game. But if you even think about what happened to North Korea in Trump's first term, I mean, the guy in North Korea was sending missiles over Japan, what, every week saying he could hit California. Trump met with him once and he never sent another missile. Why? Because he likes Trump? No. For another reason. So, we're going to see a lot of negotiations played out here. I don't think there'll be a lot of decisions that become a big negative for us or for the U.S. economy. I think the United States of America has a lot of leverage right now, and I think we have a leader that knows how to use leverage. Andrew Carter -- Analyst Fair enough. And then, kind of switching gears a little bit, you talked about going into kind of a massive kind of cash flow mode. How are you thinking about that in terms of kind of the external investments you funded? I know you talked a little bit about prioritization last call. I don't know if those are being deemphasized, those are off the table. But in terms of the guest house, the real estate JV, do you go lean into those more heavily? Or is it just a straight, more of a prioritization on the core business? Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, I think there's -- look, there's always a prioritization in the core business. There are certain opportunities that will unveil themselves at certain times, and like an Aspen joint-venture and the develop -- the opportunity to develop an ecosystem in Aspen, which we think is a one-of-a-kind opportunity. And we think there'll be a -- we think a very good, if not outstanding return on that investment as it unfolds. Unfortunately, we hit a housing market, you know, downdraft and high interest rates, and that's not necessarily good for an investment cycle in real estate. So, those things get deprioritized. But, you know, we do have a Gallery opening there. We have a guest house that's coming. We finally got the city to approve our facade, and we'll probably do a few residences and other things that we've talked about. Yeah. So, that will happen. And I think it will start to become more of a harvesting cycle from an investment cycle in the Aspen JV. You know, we'll turn real estate assets into cash. We have -- you know, we'll have a gallery, we'll have a guest house and so on and so forth. And, you know, the prioritization, I think, will always be on the core business. Everything we do, whether it is an Aspen JV or any other investments we make, are all to amplify and render the core business more valuable, you know, to amplify the core business, amplify the brand, how people think about the brand, how people see about the brand -- see the brand and perceive the brand. And I think we're doing a very good job in building a globally iconic brand. I don't think we're there yet, but we are there, you know, looking through a lot of people's eyes. I mean, this brand, I think, is seen very differently than any other brand in our category. I don't think anybody is close from a brand perception point of view. And that's, you know, taken years of investment, years of work to craft. Are we where we think we want to be? No, this brand will continue to evolve. But as I said earlier, we are in a significant investment mode, the biggest we've ever had. We're cycling some of that. We will keep investing. I don't think it will be today as -- what the opportunities we see, I don't think it will be at the same pace. A lot of the investments we've made, whether it's building this new brand extension and other things, there's typical investments, hey, is there an advertising investment to mail a book? Of course, there is. You know, do we have to build new stores for that new investment? No. Do we -- you know, does it leverage our current platform? Yes. Is it merchandised by the same people? Yes. Is it the same product development team? Yes. Is it -- so there's massive leverage in a lot of things we're doing. But, you know, setting up Europe is an expensive piece. And so, you know, that deleverage 230 basis points or so. If you just pack that 230 basis points on this business, you know, the model looks a lot better. If you took some of the other investments out that we've made in the real estate platform and other things, you know, that are creating more depreciation, the model looks pretty good in a very down housing market. Now, recast that model with the inflection in vector that is being built and, you know, an investment cycle that's going down, right, is how I say it. So, you get a completely different outcome from a free cash flow point of view. Andrew Carter -- Analyst Thanks. I'll pass it on. Happy holidays. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Happy holidays. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel -- Analyst Hi. Good afternoon. Congrats on the improving momentum within the business. So, my question and it's probably going to be a bit of a follow-up here. But just looking at the business, and, Gary, you talk a lot about -- we have talked a lot about -- the last several quarters about the macro environment. We discussed it here on the call tonight. But you're looking at the business and the improving demand trajectory you're seeing. Are you -- do you think -- clearly, the new product is helping or driving this. But do you think you're also starting to see maybe the early signs of some, so to say, let-up in the U.S. housing market? Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer You know, I don't see our competitors having -- getting that. So, I -- are we the only ones getting it? I don't know. I mean, do I think there's a pent-up demand and there are few people having to buy homes? Yes, but the numbers wouldn't say it's a -- the macro is the issue. Otherwise, you'd see a more, you know, broad pickup. So, I think people are more optimistic. I think there might be, you know, a few more people stepping into the housing market. But that's -- I mean, you know, for the most part, our industry is down 7% or 8%. I mean, there's not too many people that have positive growth right now. And even if you looked at our growth from a comparable basis, there's only a two-point difference between total demand and comparable demand, right? So, could we be getting a point or two from the macro is a little better? Maybe. But I don't think that's meaningful. I think what's really meaningful is the result of a very targeted and well-executed product transformation, you know, of a size and kind that the world has never seen. Brian Nagel -- Analyst No, that's helpful. And then, just on that, my follow-up question. So, with regard to the product transformation and this, like you just said, very significant product transformation, so going forward, I think someone asked the question before, I think kind of, you know, what any we're in. I think someone said six or something. But I guess the question I'm asking is, you know, is this -- was this -- should we -- as we think about RH over the next few years, I mean, is this going to be -- is it going to be a more aggressive -- more consistent, you know, product introductions than we had over the last couple of years? Or was this really one big one step-up? Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think it -- as I tried to articulate earlier, we see a full -- a much bigger market opportunity, and I think you're going to see a much more aggressive approach to expanding the product, particularly the product offering. And really that's how we got here, right? I mean, in the early days, I think I used to talk about -- I think I talked about it publicly. I came up with a -- we came up with a term here called direct-centric growth. And we said, look, we are going to not -- in the early days, I think we're not going to limit our assortment to the size of the stores. We're going to size our assortment to the potential of the market. So, we're going to merchandise beyond the four walls of the stores, and we're going to use our sourcebooks and our website to present that assortment. And that strategy is how we went from 300 million to where we are today. I'd say in the last 10 years, you know, post the introduction of Modern, call it nine years, we kind of slowed down through that process. You know, I think we perceived ourselves as more mature, slowed down newness, slowed down expansion of the product. And that's what I tried to articulate earlier is I think we see the brand differently. I think we see the brand bigger. I think by kind of slowing down our product transformation or our product expansion and brand expansion, I think we allow competitors to enter the market that would not have been able to be successful had we kept doing what we were doing. And I think it's shaped by the fact or decision with an outcome of seeing the world more traditionally, seeing RH as a specialty brand, not a platform for taste. You know, so this idea of seeing RH not as a specialty brand, but a taste platform helps us see a much bigger market and allows us to see a much more disruptive RH brand that can take share from more people based on our taste, our style, and, you know, the power of our platform. Brian Nagel -- Analyst Appreciate it. Thank you. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. Your line is open. Jonathan Matuszewski -- Analyst Great. Good evening and thanks for taking my question. The first one's on pricing. Gary, you shared some helpful color related to clearance activity for discontinued product. I was hoping you could just comment on the pricing strategy for some of the new collections that have been recently launched. So, when you talk about maybe peak year-over-year sales growth one to two years out, is that going to be driven by higher prices from the new collections or greater unit velocity? Thanks. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I don't exactly know. Probably both. But, you know, again, we're going to keep learning. I think a lot of it is we just see a much bigger market. We have more leverage. We can use that leverage to have more disruptive value. I think people today -- if you could buy, you know, a dining chair at RH versus somewhere else, I think the consumer would feel better about buying from RH because of the positioning and the perception of our brand versus, you know, online off a -- you know, some other platform versus Wayfair versus other competitors we might have. I think you'd rather walk into one of our galleries and you would perceive that the taste and style is validated by us, that the brand, you know, halo and value you get when you built brand like us, it makes things more valuable. It renders the product more valuable. And I think that, you know, all of us tend to buy things based on our trust in that brand, based on what that brand stands for, based on what their values are. And, you know, it's kind of why we buy, why we -- why do we trust certain brands versus other brands and why do we trust them more. You know, I think we -- as consumers, we value tremendous physical experiences. We value incredible design and article presentation of product in, you know, a physical nature or a digital nature, whether it's sourcebooks or online. We value, you know, the quality perception and the design authority of brands. And I think we've built a brand that stands alone in our category today. Do we have competitors? Of course, we do. Is there people going to try to emulate what we do? Yes, they are. But I wouldn't want to be competing with us on that. So, it just allows the brand to have a bigger market because someone would -- I think someone would rather buy that chair from us than someone else if it's similar. I think they will value it more. It's no different than cars. You know, why do people pick a BMW or a Mercedes versus a Chevrolet or a Tesla versus a whatever, you know, somebody else's electric car? Because of the value they placed on that brand, the trust they have in that brand, and they -- what they believe that they're getting a better level of design and quality. And it renders the consumer more valuable. That's part of the equation people don't understand, you know, saying like, \"Hey, I got everything in my house from Wayfair,\" doesn't really render you more valuable if you're trying to position yourself higher in the economic societal perception of the world, saying you build your house -- yeah, saying, you know, you buy your house from RH, I think, renders you more valuable customers versus other people. Jonathan Matuszewski -- Analyst That's really helpful. Thank you. And then, just a quick follow-up on product. Can you give us any color in terms of maybe some of the lines that have been outperforming? Not sure if there's any commonalities in terms of maybe aesthetic or price points or any other common denominators, not sure if you're leaning into particular trends relative to other peers. Any more flavor there would be helpful. Thank you. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Why would I tell you that? Think about it for a minute, like why would I tell anybody that publicly? Jonathan Matuszewski -- Analyst Completely respect that. Just trying to get more color. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. All of our competitors are on this call. Yeah. Like why would I tell anybody that? Jonathan Matuszewski -- Analyst Thanks, Gary. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. Thank you, Jonathan. Operator Your final question comes from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Zachary Fadem -- Analyst Hey. Good afternoon, and thanks for fitting me in. Gary, following up on the balance sheet, appreciate your currency swap comments. But, you know, since earnings are constrained by about $9 in interest expense, any thoughts on the appetite for knocking out some of the debt and interest expense and the priority versus investment or buybacks or something else? Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I mean, we think we're making the right investments to create the most significant shareholder returns. So, yeah, is the debt, you know, at $9 a share compression right now? Yes, but there's 7.6 million less shares. I don't know. So, you have to do the math on the other side. And you have to think about that 7.6 million less shares two years from now, three years from now, four years, five years from now, and think about where the trajectory of the business is. And would you have rather taken 7.6 million shares out of the market and have that cash, or would you rather have that -- what do you think is going to be more valuable? And our math would tell us what we're doing is going to be exponentially more valuable, that buying our stock at 295 when we think it's going to be worth, you know, 1,200 to 2,000 down the road is going to prove to be the right move. And it's no different than when we bought 60% of the stock back in 2017, yeah, and what the price we bought that stock at and where the stock is today. So, listen, I know there's not other CEOs maybe talking about currency swaps, but I am benefited from the fact that I was owned by private equity for several years. And I worked for some very smart people, and I learned a lot. And I think about the business differently from an investment point of view maybe than others do, so we -- but, again, I'd look at our history. You could have asked the same question in, you know, 2016, '17. I mean, we've done kind of two, three major buybacks here. And -- you know, but you don't see us doing like regular automatic buybacks. You know, I think that's not a very smart thing to do. It's not looking at it like an investor. Yeah, we're buying back our stock at, you know, all-time highs. We're opportunistic thinkers and investors, and so we believe this will prove to be a very wise decision. Zachary Fadem -- Analyst Appreciate the thoughts. And then, lastly, on the decision not to renew the leases in Germany, any color there on sales or margin impact on those galleries? And is the intention to close those right away or wait until 2027? And any thoughts on just, you know, the margin constraint right now? I think you said 230 bps this year from Europe. How much of that is Germany? Thanks. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. No, well, look, we don't give this level of detail, but the -- to get the Paris and London locations, we had to take those locations also. And we weren't maybe necessarily ready to go into Germany at that point, but the Paris and London locations, we thought, were so extraordinary, it could have taken us 10 or 20 years to find locations like that, 10 or 20 years. So, we decided to take those locations. In some cases, we weren't even going to open them when we did, but we were faced with a lawsuit, potential lawsuit from a landlord. We thought we were rendering this property less valuable. So, we said, \"OK, let's open, let's not spend too much capital.\" And -- but in both those cases, you know, the landlords wanted us to renew the leases and extend the leases to 10 to 15 years. We didn't know if those were necessarily the right locations. We didn't know if it was the right timing for the market and so on and so forth. And we said, how do we secure this London location and this Paris location? You know, what are we willing to invest to get those two locations? Not that we don't like Germany. We wouldn't have launched in Germany. You know, that's not how you would have rolled out the brand. But doing this deal enabled us to probably move 10 years faster than we would have moved had we not. And so, is there an incremental $20 million investment in that? That's the way I'd look at it? Sure. Do we know if we want to extend those leases and stay where we are? Do we -- or maybe there's better locations in Germany with better rent. You know, but that's how we think about it. No different than that. Again, it's -- every investment decision, you have to look at all the aspects of it, and you have to kind of say, is it more important to do this now and invest now, and maybe it's going to cost something upfront like the hit we're taking on Germany? Yeah. But I'd argue, when we look at it 10 years later, we may not have a London gallery, a Paris gallery like the ones we have today. You know, we might not have even pulled the trigger. So, generally, you know, those people that move faster and do more wind up with better outcomes, right, because you're going to learn along the way. So, nothing more than that. You know, the noncash charge, we're still open. If you want to look at our business at an EBIT level and operating margin level next year, it's going to be accretive to operating margin and EBIT next year, neutral on a cash point of view. Zachary Fadem -- Analyst Makes sense. Thanks for the time. Happy holidays. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. Thanks, Zach. Happy holidays. Operator That is all the time we have for questions. I'll turn the call to Gary Friedman for closing remarks. Gary G. Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Great.

answers: operator [operator instructions] first question come line michael lasser ubs. line open. michael lasser -- analyst good morning. good afternoon. thank much taking question. outperformance relative industry obviously wide. so, thinking taking advantage this, that, would accelerate investment making 2025? case, would willing trade margins, suppress margin, even meant still accelerating sales? thank much. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer so, michael, think that's always question business leaders. investment cycle look like? harvesting cycle look like? thinking business long term versus short term? know, think interesting time industry. there's multiple people pursuing different paths. generally, time like hunkering harvesting time. people pull back investments. looked history, always investment period side downturn housing market usually lead potential gain significant market share side. so, yes, look forward. would say, today, view would significant investment behind us, know, early investment europe. more, initial investment europe put platform able launch business pretty significant. some, know, significant investment rh paris rh london rh milan. cash spend behind us, right, even, know, think investment made transform product last 24 month real effort began, know, couple year ago. so, ramping building muscle need operate level operating today really behind us. think new significant brand extension discussing, product pipeline. mean, could technically launch today. kind polishing up. so, investment mostly behind us. but, know, company based invention innovation. based investing future, based kind of, know, endless growth, will. so, know, wanted think generally happens retail brand time. know, like say retail mall nothing graveyard short-lived ideas. that's because, know, retailer open new concept. get enough right. expand it. evolve it. innovate. kind get model going open 20 year, 40 year. pretty soon, blink, seven year go by. somebody has, know, range 100 300 stores. kind dated tired focus invention innovation. there's focus rollout duplication. that's retail brand even last full term lease. look retail mall take snapshot today look back 10 year look forward 10 years, 65% retail mall evolved every 10 15 year -- know, lot retailer make term lease. so, know, someone different nature, right? journey -- know, 24th year, took business basically bankrupt business, kind dig grave, right? so, started underground, will, kind dig way out. then, building, kind pursuing path climb luxury mountain try build luxury brand. that's taken, yeah, considerable investment. today, just, again, motor look platform built think -- put current number context, right, know, lot deleverage operating model significant investment made. cash investment behind us. so, look forward think cashflow next couple years, see, know, significantly increasing compounding cashflow model. see really significant capital investment beyond kind iconic brand-building galleries. even point view, cash mostly door company, know, paris london forth. it, going drag depreciation going forward made lot investments. that's, know, think probably important think model looking forward focus adjusted ebitda margin, right? that's going -- adjusted ebitda margin kind cash generation, that's going right way look model like ours. know, different than, many years, amazon depressed model serious investment mode build platform nobody else ever built. might never see again. believe that's relative story. know, go back last 10 12, 14 year think investment made platform, think number significant gallery unlike anything industry, nobody close. think about, know, built last several years, think product transformation gone investment take build that, know, inventory investment take to, know, front-load business like inventory add inventory create inflection, right? then, think inventory kind invest kind bridge create ditch transition current product new product. serious investment cycle and, know, somewhat distorts short-term view model. think take vector, is, know, significantly increasing, right, magnitude direction, kind chart vector time. think significant amount investment cycle kind behind us, could plot model might look like next two, three, four, five years. then, compound accelerating housing market, come, right? mean, depressed housing market u seen history experience, kind appreciate position today look next five years. michael lasser -- analyst got you. helpful. follow-up question is, look next couple years, a, think -- baseline assumption housing market improve, lead acceleration recent trajectory business seen think start model next year beyond? b, given pacing margin decline rh experienced last couple year sale pressure, right frame reference think margin recover degree sharpness pace sale growth maintains like seen recently? thank you. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer yeah, think that's directionally marked, right? mean, question is, housing market worth? worth 5% come back. likely worth 30%, right? and, know, kind compound couple years. might start worth 10, compound to, know, 15. might spike, might see housing market come back, right? might see 30% growth. could see 50% growth. think depressed long, think built-up potential demand many people wanted move several years, know, expanding families, people relocating, turning renters, forth the, know, significant gap interest rates, right, many people locked low interest rates. so, that's going evolve, that's going change, know, exactly happens. kind ambivalent that. quite frankly, sometimes, talk internally about, \"hey, hope housing market stay flat another year.\" lot less competitor does. gain lot market share does. so, necessarily enthusiastic housing market come back bad housing market brand like positioned way actually kind good thing think future look like, lot ankle biter able to, know, raise capital easily, know, last five, 10 year especially, know, pre-covid, five year covid and, know, four, five year covid, mean, everything home business looking great, could raise capital really easy. someone could start online brand, level competition. there's place shop. there's people marketing. there's people, know, instagram marketing online marketing forth. there's proliferation competitor housing market. see shrinking quickly. know, there's lot public bankruptcy or, know, say almost bankrupt kind bankrupt bought bankruptcy there's couple online aggregators. can't remember name one brand that's bought bunch them. probably need say anyway. guy probably know are. yeah, but, know, kind gavin grover, our, know, lead outside counsel, says, know, \"two drunk people, know, leaning bar create better situation.\" know, take kind multiple bad brand put together hope leverage aggregation -- usually work. mean, look recent situation with, know, overstock.com bed bath & beyond. mean, anybody betting marriage. think, going to, know, look good long term. yeah, so, know, would think that, yes, there's many level opportunity. there's housing market. there's housing market stay down. there's going people struggling market, know, furniture-based home furnishing market. there's going opportunity side. mean, inflection happening regardless, right? so, know, ask yourself, last time brand size scale mature market created market share, share lead five point 10 points? know, five point would considered really good. ten point would considered outstanding. 25 45 point look like? track next years. know, completely change everything. michael lasser -- analyst thank much, good holiday. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer thank you, too. next question come christopher horvers jpmorgan. line open. christopher horvers -- analyst thanks, good evening, everybody. so, keep question two-parter. first question is, guiding fourth quarter seeing quarter date, caution behalf? sort seasonality business think proceeding quarter? then, second part put lot clearance past year introduce newness, 80% newness year. expectation time get clearance margin back? thanks much. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer good question. guide is, think, kind correct guide. depends -- know, rest december january play out. so, 75 percent roughly business, balance 73 76, think, kind core rh brand think it. another, know, quarter business thing like contract, outlet, baby child, teen, waterworks, dmitriy, etc. kind pull back think -- know, business accelerating like core brand, right? kind outlined letter accelerate, many them. know, obviously waterworks impacted product transformation, but, know, platform enable waterworks brand, too, thing might able past. different than, know, -- know, scaled businesses. but, markdown percentage, looked history business core business, would say amount markdowns. like today, look it, 75% -- today, look it, 80% business third quarter full price -- full price, 20% markdown. fluctuate 2022, know, 78-22, 80-20. years, like really housing market, could low 90-10, there's always percentage clearance. would say, competitive set, general industry whole, would love 80-20 mix, right, love 80-20 mix. clearance part business may pressure would good housing market? sure. know, clearance part business going bigger bad housing market? course, is. firm grasp obvious, right? thing is, know, read letter, know, hear talk disruptive nature brand, seen u kind move past couple year much attack mode. and, know, think ability take oxygen room, playing game playing right now. necessarily -- clearance game, design quality value game. it's, know, looking at, know, disrupting market design point view, quality point view, value point view. think that's today. so, know, maybe that's putting little bit pressure margin initially. grow like are, there's inherent efficiency scale, right?so, think demand trend today, think u ordering back products, think leverage going get partner -- manufacturing partner going get future order might look like, could higher margins, right? taking market share, taking oxygen room, creating leverage business model top line point view, know, putting investment place, continuing expand margin, know, leverage get throughout platform -- say platform, also talking manufacturing platform, vendor partners. manufacturing. factory north carolina, upholstery stuff, etc. mostly, manufacturing platform. partner ours, know, talk interface partner like one company. talk leverage, scale create, know, better margin, know, better pricing, disruptive pricing, forth. think, right now, better time invest disruptive pricing disable competitor harvest business take lower sales. know, different people taking different paths. people taking -- know, giving market share, know, trying take market share, harvesting, right, expanding operating margin margin right now. could that, too. could that, too. rather trending 30% core rh business 3% 5% giving share time. lot leverage side running 30. fact, -- lot leverage significantly stronger market position. christopher horvers -- analyst thank much. great holiday. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer thank you. operator next question come line simeon gutman morgan stanley. line open. zach abraham -- analyst hi. zach simeon. thanks taking question. following free cashflow commentary earlier, speak expect rh turn free cashflow positive? follow-up, think funding need business whether self-funded? thank you. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer yeah, believe next year turn free cash flow positive we'll, know, able self-fund business. mean, know, significant part debt is, know, really think debt, right? think currency swap, right? look debt independently, say, \"oh, lot debt.\" look somewhat differently. think currency swap. one, spend money. buy anything. buy physical assets. buy building debt. know, build distribution center debt. exchanged one-currency debt believe exponentially valuable currency, stock, highly liquid currency, right? turn stock cash tomorrow. so, know, took debt, exchanged currency stock. know, today, know, post interest cost debt, know, turned $2.25 billion investment -- know, significantly, made several hundred million dollar investment already based closing price stock today. mean, look stock trading hours, investment look significantly bigger, right? so, know, baseline, know, business trend expected return growth housing market, return, believe, grow exponentially, right? but, know, -- debt balance sheet needed cash. meaningful part debt balance sheet wanted currency exchange. wanted purchase stock undervalued. think bought 7.6 million share average price 295. know, where's stock hour right now? four something? jack preston -- chief financial officer yeah, think 450 last saw it. allison malkin -- investor relation four hundred fifty-one. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer yeah, 452. so, that's pretty good return -- would return be? mean, -- what's cost capital period, 100 something -- jack preston -- chief financial officer three hundred fifty, 350 million today. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer yeah. so, $350 million return. so, look, done before. first time done this. look history, taken debt, exchanged stock, created significant value shareholders. largest single shareholder company. that's way think it. zach abraham -- analyst thank you. operator next question come steven zaccone citi. line open. steve zaccone -- analyst right. good afternoon. thanks taking question. congrats accelerated momentum. curious, gary, could help u understand driver really acceleration business. know, what's really changed product? feel competitive positioning? think outperforming industry wide margin? then, industry come back stronger '25, think well-positioned scale fulfill higher demand? gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer well, think everything believe letter. know there's lot say than, know, letter might commented that's far think outperforming. mean, -- know, lot competitive advantages. platform that, know, significantly believe better anybody else industry. have, know, product capabilities, know, savvy, know, taste believe better anybody industry. said before, taste scale scale taste, believe idea scaling taste large far reaching. so, that's doing. believe taste level, know, demonstrated product, demonstrated the, know, gallery built physical, know, aspect business, sourcebooks, website, on, forth. know, believe building platform taste that's going highly disruptive lucrative long run. that's, know, that's taste level and, know, capability scaling taste, know, ability curate -- ability, know, curate product, ability integrate product. ability present product better anyone world, think, demonstrated based size scale profitability business thus far. continue create strategic separation go forward. so, that's core, right? that's do. that's spent 24 year building. seen center innovation product leadership. know, anybody call, recommend, know, try schedule visit nobody anything like it. know, built. huge competitive advantage. methodology way think business, way strategically think categories, way strategically integrate category singular focused point view break clutter market. reason outperforming. so, know, look, -- know, talked strategic mistake made turned product engine covid because, know, get goods. know, cut order beginning covid, know, business went 40 percent, business went 40 percent 40 percent, moved 80 point cut orders. know, factory shutting forth, hard time getting products. said let's shut product engine year. omicron hit, another cycle covid. so, product engine two years. then, tried turn product engine back on. kind lost muscle memory, executed poorly third year. so, know, everybody's competing kind were, built better version ourselves. so, know, that's -- mean, mail core book three years. so, everybody thought well rh sideline feel good today. now, well, back playing games, evolved way. think smarter ever been. driven determined ever been. creative, curious, critical ever been. think next five year company going best five year history company. think five year now, better today. so, core. know, innovation core do. steve zaccone -- analyst understood. follow-up gross margin. reported last quarter, talked august seeing positive inflection product margin. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer yeah. steve zaccone -- analyst play balance quarter? maybe think product margin fourth quarter? thanks much. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer yeah, product margin demand level still positive. have, know, adjustment selling margin. know, one market stock. think big transformation gallery bigger market stock. ship product outside box, generally good thing. so, know, took -- floor set transformation, take product floor. know, team local home delivery network pick product. product's new, box, protected packaging. take back, get fed outlets. never made transformation large. think probably, know, damage things, know, got banged moving back forth truck moving around without boxes. so, take write-off product thought, know, really sellable outlet level. jack preston -- chief financial officer plus elevated cost moving product elevated inventory transfer costs. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer yeah. yeah, go ahead, jack. jack preston -- chief financial officer yeah, one-time inventory transfer costs, too, related moving product. also rebalanced product dc get optimally positioned, -- gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer yeah, also move product europe -- jack preston -- chief financial officer europe. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer europe back america. start picking right product filled dc europe. now, see trend realized, \"oh, gosh, got much this, much that.\" well, instead marking product europe, better u ship back baltimore, know, feed core business. so, that. that's another one-time kind charge. -- general selling level, especially core business, know, liked margin trending. think there's going be, know, upward opportunity margins, downward pressure margin looking forward. jack preston -- chief financial officer gary said demand margin basis, also ship margin basis. selling margin ship basis quarter inflected positive. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer yeah. steve zaccone -- analyst ok, helpful. thanks, guys. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer great. thank you. operator next question steven forbes guggenheim. line open. steven forbes -- analyst good evening, gary, jack. gary, maybe two-part question real estate, given sort planned -- sheer number openings, right, planned next couple year here. so, start, speak maybe performance payback period store-level roics sort expecting class gallery maybe relative spoken past? then, discussion landlord developer evolved past couple years? maybe seen, know, cost pressure normalize uniqueness model pipeline itself? conversation landlord developer evolved? gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer sure. so, yeah, let's start payback roics. know, historically, always said payback of, think, one three years. believe that's still right number. right number anything built covid, right? thing that's built covid stopped started three four times, raw material cost place go two three time 4x. so, anything built covid significantly expensive, know, three time more. say general sense, building cost today build level, matter retail kind business, somewhere 70% 100% higher. so, cost u build gallery today did. good news significant inflection demand sales, expectation returning housing market lift. galleries, say, pipeline today opening relatively quick paybacks. maybe really iconic ones, like london, know, paris, might take three four years, might take two years. example, rh newport beach good example. developer partner irvine company. think cleared eight retailer us, right? so, think investment, know, developer partner would make here, cleared probably eight retailers, took dead rent several year project take anywhere two three years. take long time get approval and, know, build kind buildings. so, cleared rent several years. completely cleared site, ripped two- three-story buildings, know, clear site make construction-ready us. invested $25 million, right? got -- ti. probably invested one additional 50 60. know, directionally, still adding up. bit chaos trying get open opening party thing big complex. gallery likely pay back -- cash point view, one year, maybe one half. --but one that, one europe there's lot ti. know, street locations. so, there's a, know, somewhat bigger investment, see revenue are. london think going be. maybe two-year payback. could three-year payback. three-year payback iconic brand-defining location going control next 40 year right thing do, right? thing say is, think many big gallery already built half price cost today. know, think going really hard anyone try duplicate physical platform. almost impossible, would say. know, revenue generate, willing pay multiple time pay vast majority platform, right? -- think one key issue talked internally, create right lens investor looking forward is, know, increased depreciation, increased depreciation. yeah, look u operating margin point view, could say, \"oh, there's pressure operating margin depreciation.\" well, that's true, spent money. little bit that's kind coming paris london, -- know, come on. -- going come depreciation point view, cash point view, make sense. so, look business, again, company's largest shareholder, thinking long-term cash return look like. know, say operating margin right lens? probably not. know, adjusted ebitda probably right lens. cash flow generation next five year probably right lens. headline gallery payback going forward, say one three years. lot one pipeline today, yes, one year, one half years. know, london paris might three, something like that, might two. depends come out. think math tried lay letter about, know, rh england, right? two hour outside london, got population 10-mile radius 100,000 people. there's lot car drive gallery. still trending. know, take gallery business somewhat like $38 million. generate, know, $35 million $40 million, two hour outside london, know, 10 mile -- 10-mile radius, there's like 100,000 people, generate mayfair absolute bullseye london there's 9.7 million people? like got take multiple, right? 3x, 5x? -- know, 50% more. so, looking number way, highly optimistic europe and, know, things. probably -- based think happen, even europe, much desirable tenant especially buying building. landlord discussions, evolved the, know, past years. know, landlord doing, \"hey, performing? what's market cap look like?\" kind things. performance better, margin better, stock price higher, become attractive landlord probably better credit rating. property going get lower cap rate. and, know, that's able able past 15 year building platform. so, right now, people really excited talk developing u again. today, getting three time inbound. think that's going increase. so, optionality going better. still right now, there's bigger cost building debt higher, know, etc. -- outlook great. there'll lot optionality ahead us. time, want get oversaturated, want create whole bunch cannibalization. know, think better fewer, iconic locations, kind cover market ordinary way. so, continue selective doing, different vehicle now. know, -- see test go first freestanding design studio, design studio like built past, built thing call design studios, really small stores, right? actual interior design offices, consumer-facing, none world, right? interior designer consumer-facing offices. do. mean, point reference point, think -- interesting, think going important think. open gallery, and, know, look application interior designers, might get six 12 interior design applications. freestanding interior design office, got 200 300 applications. theory was, know, lot interior designer want work retail store. thinking changing current retail store creating separate, know, design office kind walled glass forth. still, know, may -- depending happens, know, response had, response people trying come in, consumer trying come access us, learn lot starting next week. but, know, there's going lot opportunities. then, also, volume build, volume open opportunity markets. so, thought about, know, five year ago, x market, thought going x market. now, look market 1.5x, sudden real estate deal look completely different, number market look completely different, right? so, that's where, know, could change. think could 60 70 galleries, know, bigger-size galleries, 50 60, whatever range is. sudden 50% volume three, four, five year now. sudden probably additional 30 market open there's place thought could do, 20 million in. now, do, know, 30 million in, change economic model. so, think people pretty excited rh today. think even excited they, know, digest number today think going. and, know, become like preferred anchor. like look going naples, taking nordstrom's location, building one first rh compounds. know even talked rh compound yet. no? hear it. maybe have, can't remember. anyway, whole new kind rh shopping experience, multi-building connected courtyard walkways. like nothing else anybody's ever seen. way take big site, cover site really exciting way probably spend third less capital. then, know, there's another rh compound coming walnut creek taking neiman marcus location. think landlord community see -- know, developer community see new compounds, think people going like that, too. so, really excited looking opening and, know, physical expansion brand, want cautious get oversaturated, create much cannibalization. steven forbes -- analyst thank you, gary. appreciate color. pas on. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer thanks, steve. operator next question come max rakhlenko td cowen. line open. max rakhlenko -- analyst great. thanks lot, congrats progress. so, first, inning product transformation cycle would say now? that's product itself, well gallery [inaudible] gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer inning? know, would said maybe sixth inning, know, latest trip asia vietnam. now, say might fourth inning dot have, know, continued connect. so, -- there's lot pipeline. there's lot pipeline. mean, again, read letter, there's lot happening, lot coming. significant brand extension talking might worth much everything did. so, mean, think could massively, massively accretive. so, yeah, still call maybe fourth fifth, fourth inning halfway. again, always changes, right, evolve connect dot, see more, forth. think like -- mean sound arrogant compare apple, right, point, know, someone would ask steve job introduced first apple phone, said, \"this going change everything,\" inning in? know, mean, market cap first year iphone second year iphone? maybe 500 million, something like that, maybe 400 billion, 300 billion. know apple's worth today, 2.5 trillion, right? jack preston -- chief financial officer yeah, around that. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer yeah, 3 trillion, something like that. so, do, see. know, see, do. go refer internally upward spiral. say today, upward spiral. more, seeing more, therefore, seeing more. go cycle. keep connecting dot see more. so, that's say competitors, anybody who's hunkering trying harvest harvest mode trying squeak every, know, tap point operating model, that's temporal condition. real upward spiral going lead more. know, so, keep asking inning in, might perpetually third fifth innings. max rakhlenko -- analyst keep mind. then, thinking comment previously harvesting profit road investment making made past, know, thinking magnitude margin go couple year now? gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer nothing different always thought it. know, always going level investment stage. that's if, know, brand that's based in, know, invention innovation. -- say phase went pretty massive investment cycle, scale ramp product build pipeline and, know, forth and, know, build organization new partnership that, also, know, launching europe, right? mean, that's big kind one-time investment making. behind us, yes, still here, front us. but, build platform europe, kind get brand going. look, year two, and, yeah, cycling rh england, like $8 million, like, really worried. sit go like, \"ok, -- demand tracking it, 35 million 40 million, somewhere around, think net 38, something like that, turn revenue, 32 million, something like that, 33 million, say, know, what's lending going 9.7 million people heart mayfair. said three time that, think could conservative, that's $100 million revenue. four time five time that's $130 million $160 million revenue. that's -- way, brand relatively unknown. went unknown place retailer kind, like, know, know, 100 miles, guess go like, long way anything like that. so, -- think, know, margin think margin model ought regular basis going forward. mean, also depth bad housing market. somebody said, \"oh, well, home increased 3%, right?\" that's dead cap bounce. housing market shifted yet, meaningfully growing yet. does, know, benefit it, start also see margin model be. right now, looking margin model, looking margin model based bad housing market significant investment cycle. maybe biggest investment cycle. actually absolutely biggest investment cycle ever in, right? so, probably looking kind bottom margin us. max rakhlenko -- analyst great. thanks lot. appreciate it. enjoy montecito. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer ok. sorry, miss first opening, max. operator next question come curt nagle bank america. line open. curtis nagle -- analyst great. thanks much taking it. couple ones. one, term thinking demand revenue trends, know, equalize? gap narrow? maybe specifically, looking first half '25, know, hold something similar seeing 4q? roughly right math? follow that. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer that's good question. think going -- yeah, going start narrow, stock getting better. yeah, invested inventory kind close gap. think little bumpy -- again, inflection new product, know, slows little bit. stronger point view next quarter two. clearly, see gap shrinking. end stock going up. there's whole new cycle newness coming that, know, could -- could real runaway that, know, create really high back stock and, know, longer lead time forth. so, initial gap closing, , know, could -- could get little wider bounce around bit. mean, directionally, see going back big beginning transition. curtis nagle -- analyst got it. would be, guess, high-class problem. happen. second one, guess, gary, you, trying think through, know, early stage here, potential demand synergy core product trade business acceleration and, know, expansion waterworks business, think, said, -- strong core, know, b2b customer base. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer sure. yeah. think, well, one, contract side business start there, know, almost can't benefit new product yet still getting stock best product. still building inventory get -- transform galleries. mean, newest product coming outperforming, know, phase 1 products, right? so, going transition gallery get best product, is, again, part upward spiral. so, say gallery today third right. think there's two transition gallery kind optimize that, which, mean going take best product available contract business. know, think that's mean trade business, maybe got wrong. then, know, waterworks, know, higher exposure interior designer able spec across project customer able see website, see sourcebook, know, brand recognition awareness waterworks going grow, accessibility going grow. so, know, think that's going big idea. big could be? think look like billion-dollar idea u kind track out. so, synergy taking best design translating smaller size baby child, teen going real synergy. and, know, much retailer like returns, return drive outlet business. outlet business dragged behind core business significantly, right? there's enough return new product yet, drive that. so, again, part upward spiral, right? one begets other. and, know, learning right now, thing seeing, dot connect there's whole new set data had. so, data becomes richer, know, become smarter, start investing wiser. next idea likely better last idea informed. knowledge. making better decisions, assessing thing correctly. so, know answer question not. curtis nagle -- analyst no, that's clear, appreciate it, gary. happy holidays. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer great. thank you. thank you, curtis. operator next question come seth basham wedbush securities. line open. seth basham -- analyst thanks lot, good afternoon. question regarding product transformation characterize inflection. previously talked peak inflection point sometime early 2025. so, upward spiral seeing right now, would think peak inflection extended outwards? gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer massively outwards. yeah, talk peak inflection, like think knew. almost nothing, right? new product hitting. saw trend product. tracking out. look like? enough data information really know knew. so, got worse. peak inflection based know, think, several year out. seth basham -- analyst previously, talked peak inflection sort strongest year-over-year growth. assume thinking strongest year-over-year growth going year out, think see strong growth next years, words. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer think strongest growth might year two significant brand extension talked significant. small. meaningful. amount new product that's coming -- example, year ago, probably year transformation, kind reframed everything internal team external partners. said, \"look, still early stage called product development super cycle.\" something never done. enough data say, like, much bigger. think market completely differently. think size market, consumer. see consumers. see homes. see rooms. see aesthetics. see significantly bigger opportunity rh. ways, say classical way think u kind specialty brand, right, certain point view. that's probably say looked u last 20 years. build specialty brand certain aesthetic point view grow brand? think u differently today. think u lot differently last 45 days. articulated completely clearly based learned. directionally framed last five years, right, long-term business vision ecosystem. said taste scale. scale taste. idea scaling taste large far-reaching. -- then, articulated, right, call one-pager, kind bigger view play. think nuance is, now, beginning see u team, know, beginning see u maybe platform taste. brand. so, think -- know, think platform marketplaces. mean, wayfair marketplace. know, somewhat, brand? course. recognized certain thing forth. really -- know, product. available everywhere else. there's nothing unique product wayfair. platform marketplace, know, that's driving $12 billion revenue, number like that, right? furniture, sell lot things. start say, transition thinking rh classic way think specialty brand think rh platform taste think could dimensionalize taste across multiple aesthetics, across different life stages, across different kind homes, forth, that, us, look multiple time bigger potentially thought could be. and, know, still kind shaping thinking. see relatively clearly today. that's think growth trajectory vector may continue longer think. may think, know, running core business trending 25 30 up, right? well, going come 25 30, going grow 8 10 top that? know. grow 30 40 top that? impossible based see today. want -- promising anything. trying give kind guidance. trying kind share directly thinking see. again, do, see. see, do. see lot ever seen right product transformation product development super cycle. thing dot connecting. so, think upward spiral exponentially bigger last significantly longer would asked couple month ago. seth basham -- analyst wonderful. last follow-up. so, know provide information next year, significant brand extension think could worth billion dollars, within furniture adjacent beyond furniture? gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer no, kind within thing doing. unique, different, aesthetically different, probably address biggest part market. -- think going amplified think trend coming. seth basham -- analyst wonderful. can't wait. thanks lot, gary. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer ok. thank you, seth. operator next question come andrew carter stifel. line open. andrew carter -- analyst hey, thank you. good evening. wanted ask inventory, kind going quarter, purchase 30%. could talk kind kind inefficiency there? planning around there? know exiting china. safety stock that, already contemplating exiting mexico. two points, correct wrong, china 22% purchase dollar last year. know ever disclosed mexico. going term -- thanks. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer so, first part everything said, say correct. would answer. last part, know, where's going? think said going china. depends what's happening mexico. look, donald trump wrote \"the art deal,\" right? ever read \"the art deal,\" -- do, see negotiating starting play out. -- global negotiation happening right now. mexico -- happen mexican tariffs? move make proactively? making move proactively, think mexico making moves. already hearing inside source moving troop border. know, going try take responsibility immigration. president mexico, sure would want biggest economy world cut trade. so, know, mexico, think, little different china, right? mexico going become next global superpower military threaten united states. china can, right? so, think country never attacked besides 9/11, basically terrorist boarding plane flying buildings, that's unique attack. military attacked united state internationally home ground. since when? andrew carter -- analyst 1812? yeah. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer yeah, yeah. exactly. why? strongest military nuclear arsenal world. so, mean, look, donald trump great negotiator. think looking world's playing field saying, use leverage? negotiation without leverage impersonation. better hope find are. so, really good using leverage. done before. seeing now. even taken office, art deal full play right now. actually quite impressive, would say. so, mexico going play out? think -- mexico, want faucet turned off. want 25% tariffs. saying going happen. may happen, may happen while. think much leverage there. china whole different story. whole different game. even think happened north korea trump's first term, mean, guy north korea sending missile japan, what, every week saying could hit california. trump met never sent another missile. why? like trump? no. another reason. so, going see lot negotiation played here. think there'll lot decision become big negative u u.s. economy. think united state america lot leverage right now, think leader know use leverage. andrew carter -- analyst fair enough. then, kind switching gear little bit, talked going kind massive kind cash flow mode. thinking term kind external investment funded? know talked little bit prioritization last call. know deemphasized, table. term guest house, real estate jv, go lean heavily? straight, prioritization core business? gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer well, think there's -- look, there's always prioritization core business. certain opportunity unveil certain times, like aspen joint-venture develop -- opportunity develop ecosystem aspen, think one-of-a-kind opportunity. think there'll -- think good, outstanding return investment unfolds. unfortunately, hit housing market, know, downdraft high interest rates, that's necessarily good investment cycle real estate. so, thing get deprioritized. but, know, gallery opening there. guest house that's coming. finally got city approve facade, probably residence thing talked about. yeah. so, happen. think start become harvesting cycle investment cycle aspen jv. know, turn real estate asset cash. -- know, gallery, guest house forth. and, know, prioritization, think, always core business. everything do, whether aspen jv investment make, amplify render core business valuable, know, amplify core business, amplify brand, people think brand, people see brand -- see brand perceive brand. think good job building globally iconic brand. think yet, there, know, looking lot people's eyes. mean, brand, think, seen differently brand category. think anybody close brand perception point view. that's, know, taken year investment, year work craft. think want be? no, brand continue evolve. said earlier, significant investment mode, biggest ever had. cycling that. keep investing. think today -- opportunity see, think pace. lot investment made, whether building new brand extension things, there's typical investments, hey, advertising investment mail book? course, is. know, build new store new investment? no. -- know, leverage current platform? yes. merchandised people? yes. product development team? yes. -- there's massive leverage lot thing doing. but, know, setting europe expensive piece. so, know, deleverage 230 basis point so. pack 230 basis point business, know, model look lot better. took investment made real estate platform things, know, creating depreciation, model look pretty good housing market. now, recast model inflection vector built and, know, investment cycle that's going down, right, say it. so, get completely different outcome free cash flow point view. andrew carter -- analyst thanks. pas on. happy holidays. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer happy holidays. thank you. operator next question brian nagel oppenheimer. line open. brian nagel -- analyst hi. good afternoon. congrats improving momentum within business. so, question probably going bit follow-up here. looking business, and, gary, talk lot -- talked lot -- last several quarter macro environment. discussed call tonight. looking business improving demand trajectory seeing. -- think -- clearly, new product helping driving this. think also starting see maybe early sign some, say, let-up u.s. housing market? gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer know, see competitor -- getting that. so, -- one getting it? know. mean, think there's pent-up demand people buy homes? yes, number say -- macro issue. otherwise, see more, know, broad pickup. so, think people optimistic. think might be, know, people stepping housing market. that's -- mean, know, part, industry 7% 8%. mean, there's many people positive growth right now. even looked growth comparable basis, there's two-point difference total demand comparable demand, right? so, could getting point two macro little better? maybe. think that's meaningful. think what's really meaningful result targeted well-executed product transformation, know, size kind world never seen. brian nagel -- analyst no, that's helpful. then, that, follow-up question. so, regard product transformation this, like said, significant product transformation, going forward, think someone asked question before, think kind of, know, in. think someone said six something. guess question asking is, know, -- -- -- think rh next years, mean, going -- going aggressive -- consistent, know, product introduction last couple years? really one big one step-up? gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer think -- tried articulate earlier, see full -- much bigger market opportunity, think going see much aggressive approach expanding product, particularly product offering. really that's got here, right? mean, early days, think used talk -- think talked publicly. came -- came term called direct-centric growth. said, look, going -- early days, think going limit assortment size stores. going size assortment potential market. so, going merchandise beyond four wall stores, going use sourcebooks website present assortment. strategy went 300 million today. say last 10 years, know, post introduction modern, call nine years, kind slowed process. know, think perceived mature, slowed newness, slowed expansion product. that's tried articulate earlier think see brand differently. think see brand bigger. think kind slowing product transformation product expansion brand expansion, think allow competitor enter market would able successful kept doing. think shaped fact decision outcome seeing world traditionally, seeing rh specialty brand, platform taste. know, idea seeing rh specialty brand, taste platform help u see much bigger market allows u see much disruptive rh brand take share people based taste, style, and, know, power platform. brian nagel -- analyst appreciate it. thank you. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer thank you. operator next question come jonathan matuszewski jefferies. line open. jonathan matuszewski -- analyst great. good evening thanks taking question. first one's pricing. gary, shared helpful color related clearance activity discontinued product. hoping could comment pricing strategy new collection recently launched. so, talk maybe peak year-over-year sale growth one two year out, going driven higher price new collection greater unit velocity? thanks. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer exactly know. probably both. but, know, again, going keep learning. think lot see much bigger market. leverage. use leverage disruptive value. think people today -- could buy, know, dining chair rh versus somewhere else, think consumer would feel better buying rh positioning perception brand versus, know, online -- know, platform versus wayfair versus competitor might have. think rather walk one gallery would perceive taste style validated us, brand, know, halo value get built brand like us, make thing valuable. render product valuable. think that, know, u tend buy thing based trust brand, based brand stand for, based value are. and, know, kind buy, -- trust certain brand versus brand trust more. know, think -- consumers, value tremendous physical experiences. value incredible design article presentation product in, know, physical nature digital nature, whether sourcebooks online. value, know, quality perception design authority brands. think built brand stand alone category today. competitors? course, do. people going try emulate do? yes, are. want competing u that. so, allows brand bigger market someone would -- think someone would rather buy chair u someone else similar. think value more. different cars. know, people pick bmw mercedes versus chevrolet tesla versus whatever, know, somebody else's electric car? value placed brand, trust brand, -- believe getting better level design quality. render consumer valuable. that's part equation people understand, know, saying like, \"hey, got everything house wayfair,\" really render valuable trying position higher economic societal perception world, saying build house -- yeah, saying, know, buy house rh, think, render valuable customer versus people. jonathan matuszewski -- analyst that's really helpful. thank you. then, quick follow-up product. give u color term maybe line outperforming? sure there's commonality term maybe aesthetic price point common denominators, sure leaning particular trend relative peers. flavor would helpful. thank you. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer would tell that? think minute, like would tell anybody publicly? jonathan matuszewski -- analyst completely respect that. trying get color. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer yeah. competitor call. yeah. like would tell anybody that? jonathan matuszewski -- analyst thanks, gary. gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer ok. thank you, jonathan. operator final question come zach fadem well fargo. line open. zachary fadem -- analyst hey. good afternoon, thanks fitting in. gary, following balance sheet, appreciate currency swap comments. but, know, since earnings constrained $9 interest expense, thought appetite knocking debt interest expense priority versus investment buyback something else? gary g. friedman -- chairman chief executive officer mean, think making right investment create significant shareholder returns. so, yeah, debt, know, $9 share compression right now? yes, there's 7.6 million less shares. know. so, math side. think 7.6 million less share two year now, three year now, four years, five year now, think trajectory business is. would rather taken 7.6 million share market cash, would rather -- think going valuable? math would tell u going exponentially valuable, buying stock 295 think going worth, know, 1,200 2,000 road going prove right move. different bought 60% stock back 2017, yeah, price bought stock stock today. so, listen, know there's ceo maybe talking currency swaps, benefited fact owned private equity several years. worked smart people, learned lot. think business differently investment point view maybe others do, -- but, again, look history. could asked

         "Lyft ( LYFT 4.35% ) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Nov 06, 2024 , 5:00 p.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Good afternoon, and welcome to the Lyft third quarter 2024 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aurelien Nolf, vice president, FP&A and investor relations. You may begin. Aurelien Nolf -- Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations Thank you. Welcome to the Lyft earnings call for the third quarter of 2024. On the call today, we have our CEO, David Risher; and our CFO, Erin Brewer. We'll make forward-looking statements on today's call relating to our business strategy and performance, partnerships, future financial results, and guidance. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied during this call. These factors and risks are described in our earnings materials and our recent SEC filings. All of the forward-looking statements that we make on today's call are based on our beliefs as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. Additionally, today we are going to discuss customers. For rideshare, there are two customers in every car. The driver is the Lyft customer, and the rider is the driver's customer. We care about both. Our discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures which are not a substitute for GAAP results. Reconciliation of our historical GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our earning materials, which are available on our IR website. And with that, I'll pass the call to David. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Aurelien. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. Once again, our team executed on all parts of our strategic plan, resulting in a spectacular third quarter with progress on what matters most to riders and drivers more than 2 million times a day. Erin will get into the details about our performance this quarter, but a driver from North Carolina put it well when they called Lyft superior to the other guys because of better transparency and overall better pay per ride. As we outlined at our Investor Day, our customer obsession engine was fueled by several product innovations, progress with Lyft Media, and some big partnership announcements. First, we said we would differentiate with product innovation. Our strategy is simple but effective: obsess over our customers. That's what we did for commuters when we introduced Price Lock. Commute rides make up nearly half of rides Monday to Friday, so it's no wonder Price Lock is performing beyond our expectations. By the end of September, we already had more than 200,000 active passes, and this number keeps growing. We see that Price Lock riders take on average four more rides per month than they previously did before purchasing the pass. Not only is Price Lock helping commuters, but also drivers by creating more predictability on when and where to drive. It's a win-win. We're pleased with how Price Lock is performing and we're taking feedback from early users to further enhance the product. Related to this, we're always thinking about and providing more value to our riders. So, here's an update on that can of whoopass I mentioned last time on prime time, which our team is -- which is our term for surge pricing. Primetime continues to decrease and is now down more than 40% year over year and 20% quarter on quarter on a per-ride basis. In the regions where prime time declines fast, inversion goes up along with rides and market share. Chicago is a great example where we saw prime time decline very fast in Q3, resulting in conversion improvements, ride growth acceleration, and share gains. I've said before that our strategy was to take rideshare's most hated feature and turn it into a reason to choose Lyft, and again this quarter we're seeing the proof that that's the right strategy. More recently we launched a new set of improvements for drivers to better ensure that every ride and every minute they spend on the road is worthwhile. Imagine driving with Lyft and you accept a ride for a given amount of pay, but you end up sitting in unexpected traffic. The ride takes longer, and on an hourly basis, you earn less than you expected. Not a great experience. So, we addressed it. Now, drivers can count on their earnings being increased anytime a ride takes five minutes longer than estimated. Drivers now also see the estimated dollar-per-hour rate for every ride on the accept screen to help them decide if a ride is worth their time. And if you drive an EV, you can choose to only match with rides that fall within your battery range, a really important change that takes care of range anxiety. All told, just this year we've launched 33 new products and features, a true testament to our team listening to drivers and riders and delivering on the innovations they want. As a result, we're seeing all-time highs across both driver and rider metrics. Drivers are spending more time with Lyft than they ever have, as driver hours in Q3 reached yet another all-time high. According to interviews, driver preference for Lyft is now 12 percentage points higher than our main competitor. At Investor Day back in June, we said we expect driver-hour growth in line with business growth, and right now we're ahead of that target. On the rider side, we see the same. Active riders hit an all-time high, growing at a pace ahead of the long-term target we shared at our Investor Day. We had record rides again this quarter, with commute rides surpassing their all-time highs from 2019. Ride frequency, the average number of rides taken by each active rider, increased for the seventh consecutive quarter. It is also in line with our long-term target. Riders are taking more bike and scooter rides too. Our bikes and scooters mode had strong performance in Q3, breaking another record in quarterly rides. Bottom line, Lyft is still growing. Up next is more expansion in Canada, where right now we're onboarding drivers in Winnipeg. At this point, roughly 12% of all Canadians have taken a ride with Lyft and we look forward to riders in Winnipeg joining us soon. So, now, on to Lyft Media. We've been building Lyft Media into a highly performant platform. And we continue to improve it for our ad partners. Last month, we expanded how we measure campaign performance. Brands like Foursquare are now helping us measure foot traffic to brick-and-mortar stores. NCSolutions provides insights on brand loyalty for consumer packaged goods companies. And Kochava is measuring digital outcomes like app installs and purchases. Overall Lyft Media continues to gain great traction with in-app ads growing nearly 3x year over year in Q3. Now, I want to take a look at two partnership-focused initiatives that will help strengthen Lyft's position going forward. We are very proud of the best of what we do in rideshare. We are the pure play in on-demand mobility, and that allows us to be 100% focused on getting it right for drivers and riders every time. As we said at Investor Day, that approach includes deeply partnering with other companies for the best of what they do. For food delivery, that's DoorDash. DashPass has millions of subscribers and with last week's partnership announcement, we're giving every one of them a reason to prefer Lyft. So, I encourage each and every one of you to link your accounts immediately so you can save the next time you go out with friends and then on that late-night snack when you get home. Second, today we announced our next step in helping bring autonomous vehicles to millions of people. And again, we're doing that in partnership, beginning with Mobileye, Nexar, and May Mobility. Let me talk about each of these briefly. With Mobileye, our partnership makes our rideshare platform available to all vehicles with Mobileye Drive level for self-driving technology. These vehicles will be Lyft-ready, giving small and large fleet operators seamless access to Lyft's platform network of riders. With Nexar, our partnership combines Lyft's vast network with Nexar's intelligent video telematics with the goal of accelerating how AVs learn. And finally, we're very excited to partner with May Mobility to make their autonomous vehicles available to Lyft riders in Atlanta next year. Each of these partnerships plays a different role, but collectively, they help Lyft become the best option for AV stakeholders and asset holders to go to market. At Lyft, we envision a robust future that brings together human drivers and autonomous vehicles in an always-on transportation network. Adding AVs is a huge opportunity, and we look forward to partnering with even more leaders in the industry to shape this future. Stay tuned because this is just the beginning. Before I finish up, I want to share something with you that is foundational to the way we lead our company, and that's our purpose. The team at Lyft has always been passionate about having an impact. It's often cited as the reason people love our brand and why people choose us. It's one of the reasons I came here too. And it's good for business in ways beyond brand love. Research shows that the purpose-driven organizations have returns that significantly outperform the S&P 500. Lyft's purpose is to serve and connect. Let me say that again. Because it's new. Our purpose is to serve and connect. On service, we want to reset the bar, serving drivers and riders better than they have ever experienced before. And on connection, in an increasingly virtual but physically disconnected world, we're going to fight hard to keep bringing people together in person. Lyft is moving ahead. Quarter after quarter, we're winning riders and drivers over -- winning drivers and riders over with our service. As a result, people are choosing rideshare more, and when they choose rideshare, they're increasingly choosing Lyft. Sure, we're competing against the other guy and are more than holding our own, but increasingly, you'll find that we're playing a different game. We're competing with your car, even with your couch. Every day, over 2 million times we serve and connect, and I hope you see how early we are in that journey and just how important that purpose is. Over to you, Erin. Erin Brewer -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm excited to share an update on our results for the third quarter as well as the outcome of our recent insurance renewals, the next steps regarding our capital allocation plans, and our increased outlook for the full year 2024. Now, let's get into the details of the quarter. I'll start with my usual reminder that unless otherwise indicated, all income statement measures are non-GAAP and exclude select items that are detailed in our earnings materials. For the third quarter, gross bookings exceeded $4.1 billion, up 16% year over year, with double-digit rides growth in both rideshare as well as our bikes and scooters mode. Q3 saw strong demand with active riders growth of 9% and frequency up 6% driven by growth in Canada, our back-to-school activations, and the success of new products, all underpinned by our focus on operational excellence. While demand exceeded our expectations in the quarter, gross bookings per ride and the continued reduction in prime time were in line with our expectations. As we discussed last quarter, reducing the variability from prime time addresses a significant concern for our riders, ultimately drives preference for Lyft, and makes our platform healthier. Revenue exceeded $1.5 billion, up 32% year over year. During the quarter, we delivered revenue margin expansion, both year over year and sequentially, reflecting efficiency in the deployment of incentives. Consistent with the framework we outlined at our Investor Day in June, our focus is on generating efficiencies on a per-ride basis across total incentive spend. During the quarter, incentive expenses in contra revenue and sales and marketing combined declined 17% on a per-ride basis year over year, well ahead of the annual multiyear target of 10% we outlined at Investor Day as we continue to improve the balance of our marketplace. Operating expenses were $602 million or 14.7% of gross bookings, including planned investment in rider engagement and higher legal and insurance expenses, some of which are accrued on a per-ride basis. In the third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $107 million, which as a percentage of gross bookings was 2.6%. Third-quarter adjusted EBITDA included the benefit of a one-time $14 million tax accrual release. GAAP net loss in the third quarter was $12.4 million, which includes restructuring charges of $36 million related to the previously announced restructuring plans in our bikes and scooters division, now known as Lyft Urban Solutions. We ended the third quarter with a strong cash position with unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $1.9 billion, and we generated $243 million of free cash flow. As a reminder, our free cash flow trends will vary quarterly due to the timing of insurance payments. So, I'd encourage you to focus on a 12-month view. At quarter-end for the trailing 12 months, we've delivered more than $641 million in free cash flow. This outpaced our previous target, driven primarily by higher insurance reserves directly related to higher ride volume, coupled with lower cash payments related to our legacy book.Moving to capital allocation, I want to reiterate our current strategy, which focuses on three main areas. First, it's crucial for our scaled marketplace to maintain ample liquidity for operations and to comply with our existing covenants. Next, we're prioritizing investing in profitable growth. We have plans to invest in initiatives like building partnerships and enhancing our ad tech platform, which are important to our long-term growth strategy. And third, we're focused on shareholder returns, starting with dilution management. After restructuring last year, we've seen improvements in stock-based compensation dilution and remain on track to our commitment for 2024 stock-based compensation of approximately $340 million. Building on that progress, starting later this month, we will leverage our improving cash position to transition to net share settlement to address the tax withholding obligation for all employer-restricted stock units. This will reduce the number of shares that would otherwise be issued into the market upon vesting. In 2025 we expect to use approximately $100 million of our cash balance which will reduce dilution by approximately two percentage points compared to our prior tax withholding method. The use of cash will be reflected in the financing section of our statement of cash flows beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. Now, on to guidance. Our Q4 outlook includes both the impact of the DoorDash partnership as well as the renewal of our third-party insurance agreements. As we laid out at our Investor Day, partnerships are a key component of our profitable growth strategy and we're very excited about the opportunity to partner with another category leader. In the fourth quarter, we're investing in the launch, and we're excited about bringing the benefits of Lyft and DoorDash to riders and DashPass members throughout the U.S. Our experience with large-scale partnerships tells us that achieving broad consumer adoption happens with time, and we look forward to sharing more updates in the coming months. Next, the renewal of our third-party insurance agreements reflects our success in continuing to bend the insurance cost curve through product and safety initiatives. We expect our fourth quarter cost of revenue will increase by approximately $50 million quarter over quarter, reflecting the impact of our 10/1 third-party renewals. That's significant progress versus last year's increase driven by the multiyear strategy we outlined at investor day. Additionally, I'll remind you that last year we moved some agreements to a biannual cycle, creating less disruptive impacts throughout the year. As such, we're comfortable that we can manage the insurance cost increase within our operating and financial plans. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect gross bookings growth of approximately 15% to 17% year over year or approximately $4.28 billion to $4.35 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million to $105 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of gross bookings of approximately 2.3% to 2.4%. For the full year 2024, we are raising our outlook and now expect rides growth in the mid-teens year over year, gross bookings to grow approximately 17% year over year, adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of gross bookings to be approximately 2.3%, up from the prior outlook of 2.1% and free cash flow to exceed $650 million. 2024 is the first year of our multiyear plan laid out at our Investor Day in June. Through customer obsession and operational excellence, we're delivering on all our commitments and are on pace to achieve our long-term targets. With that, I'll bring our prepared remarks to a close. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] We ask that you limit yourself to one question, and for any additional questions, please requeue. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Doug Anmuth -- Analyst Thanks for taking the questions. I have two, one for David, one for Erin. David, I was hoping you could talk about the benefits that you're seeing of less prime time and surge on the platform and just how that's showing up in terms of ride volume via frequency and retention. I know you mentioned higher conversion. Just wondering if there's any way you can quantify the benefits there. And then, Erin, can you talk about the $650 million in free cash flow in 2024? I just want to make sure that we understand the drivers of the significantly higher outlook is that all function of more shift to 1P and captive, and then how do we think about that trend in '25 in sustainability? Thanks. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Doug, I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Erin. So, first, so prime time. Yeah, prime time sucks. And so, we're really trying to focus on bringing it down. And as you heard, we're down 40% year on year, which is awesome. And so, what we find when we look market by market is the areas where we get it down the fastest is where we see incursion and ride growth -- inversion and ride growth increase nicely. So, I think we mentioned Chicago in the prepared remarks. Boston's actually another city where we're seeing that work out super well. So, it's great, it's great. And it's -- maybe I liken it a little bit to Starbucks' move last week of getting rid of the stupid surcharge on oat milk and stuff. Like, it's just nobody likes it. Nobody likes that kind of variability, particularly when you're being charged for something that you didn't expect. I put it in a slightly broader frame too to say, as we look at frequency, which continues to increase, frequency is driven primarily by great service. Right? The better service you have the more likely you are to take another ride. And that's just, I mean, tautological. But then there's certain things we can do, like price lock and some other things that will actually increase frequency even more than that. So, and in prime time, it falls right in the middle of that, right? That's providing great service and also providing consistency. So, sort of put it all together, really liking what we see. I think our conversions actually increased. The number's gotten better by about 0.1 percentage point. So, we're seeing good increase there. But of course, that averages all kinds of different things. So, that's sort of the big picture on that. And then, Erin? Erin Brewer -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Sure, Doug. On cash flow, I'll kind of start hovering up a little bit here. First of all, we're incredibly proud of the performance that this team has been able to drive across the business, obviously strengthening our operating efficiency and improving our margins. And then given that we're a relatively low kind of capex profile business, from a modeling perspective, you can assume that a significant portion of that adjusted EBITDA converts to cash. And that is of course, before considering the impacts of insurance. So, let me kind of talk about the dynamics that we're seeing this year and some of the dynamics that I mentioned here in the third quarter. So, first is the function of our insurance accruals, and those are a bit higher because our growth is a bit higher than expectations. So, that's one part. The second part is lower cash payout. So, let me spend just a second here, chatting through that. When we accrue for these expenses in period, we expect the total payout from any particular cohort to take approximately seven years to resolve, with the peak of that usually happening in year three and the majority of those claims paying out sort of year one through three if you think about that overall horizon. So, today for example, it's fair to assume that the majority of claims that we're paying out are from the 2021 to 2023 time period where of course our rides volume were lower therefore fewer claims, therefore a reduction in those cash outflows. You asked a little bit about what does that mean longer term. So, looking further ahead, if you think about the near-term phase of our LRP, I think it's fair to assume that that conversion and that near-term, say, 2025 part, would be a bit higher than 90%, but likely not as high as we're seeing here in 2024. And then as we move into the outer years of that LRP, we would expect that dynamic to normalize as insurance-related accruals and cash payments would be a little bit more balanced. So, longer term, we believe that 90% plus adjusted EBITDA conversion target is appropriate. Doug Anmuth -- Analyst Great. Thank you both. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan -- Analyst Thanks so much for taking the question, really just a two-parter. When you think about some of these new partnerships you're announcing with DoorDash and on the supply side with autonomous vehicle companies, I think for DoorDash, how should we think about that driving demand on the rider and ride side in terms of an underlying assumption of what that might contribute to incremental growth? And in terms of autonomous, maybe just refresh us on your view about how adding autonomous supply and partnering across the autonomous vehicle industry landscape might alter some of what you see in terms of the growth prospects and the margin prospects going forward. Thanks so much. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Let me take -- those are two chunky ones. And so, I will -- I'll talk to partnerships and AVs, and then maybe Erin can talk a little bit about the unit economics of AVs as well. We can both kind of tag team a little bit on this. Yeah, maybe not. We'll see. We'll see, we cover. So, on partnerships, so DoorDash, super interesting, right? So, they've got about 18 million DashPass holders worldwide or 18 million customers worldwide. I think it's DashPass holders, is that right? Anyway -- so that's a big number. And some of them obviously are Lyft users, but maybe a smaller number than you might expect. And so, I think you're absolutely right, Eric, to sort of target the top line on this. This is about effectively rider acquisition, right? How can we acquire riders in a way that's super customer-friendly? Because we know that people like to take rides when they go out, and then when they come home, they'll get something delivered. So, it's off to a great start. I won't give you too many details. And I will say that all these partnerships tend to, they sort of take time to build. So, let's not get ahead of ourselves. But we certainly like what we see so far. And we can see that riders are responding to it. Signing up to link their accounts and then maybe ordering something or maybe taking a ride that they wouldn't have taken otherwise. So, yep, great to think about as a top-line driver and something that's going to unfold over time, but we like what we see so far for sure. On AVs, that one, if you don't mind, I'm going to sort of zoom out for a second. I mean, you asked specifically about additional supply, but I actually want to give a little bit of context because this isn't something we've talked too much about so far. So, the first thing I should say about AVs is, AVs are great. They're great, right? It's a good experience. You can see them on the streets of San Francisco. To be clear, it's a very bespoke experience right now. It's a very expensive car. All kinds of things are going on behind the scenes to make sure that it works super well. And the scale is quite small in the grand scheme of things. But it's a really interesting experience. And so, we absolutely see it as being a TAM expander for us, right, because it'll bring additional supply and it'll bring a new experience for riders on that some riders will like, maybe others don't choose so much. And so, the idea of having a hybrid between the two of them, between human-driven cars and robot-driven cars is super exciting to us. Our strategy is to become the partner of choice to any AV stakeholder. That might be an OEM, equipment manufacturer, any number of things. And for one basic reason, we want to be the best way to keep your AV utilized and therefore making money. And that's sort of the thing. Like, these are expensive assets, they're going to be expensive for a long time. And so, they got to be moving around, right? Just like an airplane or a restaurant's got to have people in the seats or airplanes got to be in the sky, like, these things have to be utilized. And so, I'm going to break that down a little bit, and again sorry for the long answer but it's a -- it's kind of a chunky area. So, the first is demand generation. So, three big pillars, I'm going to think about. First is demand gen, right? So, you know this. I mean, we're one of two big, scaled platforms of North America, 40 million active riders, two main rides a day. So, that I think sort of stands to reason. The second place is marketplace management So, 1.4 million drivers today are on our platform every year. That's a lot of individuals. And what do they do? What do they rely on us today for? And then you can sort of fast forward and think what are AVs going to rely on us tomorrow for? Well, they got to be onboarded, they got to be insured, they got to get paid, they got to get matched, right? 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Cars get matched with riders, which means that you have to estimate the ETA, that's pickup time, you got to price it right, you got to do customer care when things are left in the car. All of this marketplace, you got to manage pickup and drop off, and that sounds easy, but it's not because it's such an address on Fifth Avenue, it's secretly around the corner, all these sorts of things. So, this marketplace management is quite complicated, and it's something that we do at massive scale every single day. And it's the second piece, the second big pillar that any AV asset vendor is going to want to plug into. And then the third is fleet utilization. OK, so this is actually a little bit subtle. And it sounds straightforward, but it's actually quite complex. Again, of course, it's onboarding, but then it's things like maintenance. Again, think of a car as an asset. Again, for some reason, at least I find it actually easy to think of airplanes as very expensive assets that you just have to make sure you are flying around and not sitting in maintenance stocks and so forth. And so, if you think about what a car needs and answer is maintenance, right, they need to be recharged. They need to get paid for their time, maybe insure all these policy issues, all these customer care issues, all this stuff. So, we've been doing for about the past four years with our Flexdrive subsidiary a ton of this, just a ton of this. Flexdrive acquires, it leases, it manages, it maintains, it repairs, it resells, it does this over tens of thousands of cars every single year and we are the only rideshare company that has this capability in-house, I will just say that again. We're the only rideshare company that has this ability in the house. And by the way, we're good at it and I'm going to brag on behalf of the Flexdrive folks. We achieve about 90% utilization over the course of the year, which is industry-leading. OK, so you put all that together and I think you can see why AVs are so exciting for us. They're a new form of supply, you can say it sort of tactically like that. They blend very nicely with driver-driven cars, right? You don't have to choose between one or the other, you can do both. And we have the capabilities to put them to use. And by putting them to use, that makes all the stakeholders more money, which is great. And that's why they're going to choose us again and again and again. So, I think it's more than just sort of any one of those pieces. I think sort of the whole is great in some of the parts. And that is probably more than enough for AVs right now. And, Erin, did you want to add anything to any of that? Erin Brewer -- Chief Financial Officer No, you nailed it in terms of just -- I think there's a lot of great work being done out there about how this will fold over some period of time. The cost of the asset, how the regulatory and insurance environment, etc. But the bottom line, as you just said, is asset utilization is going to be incredibly important for unit economics. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Eric. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Nowak -- Analyst Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on Price Lock, it's a good early signal on adoption and frequency bump. I just wanted to ask you about, can you walk us through sort of the go-to-market strategy you're using on this? Is it available across all markets? Are you rolling it market by market? Are you targeting certain types of users and sort of rolling it that way? Just how do we think about kind of the strategic rollout of that business across the corpus of users is the first one. And then the second one just on autonomous, there's a decent amount of discussion about sort of San Francisco and Waymo, etc. So, anything you can tell us about sort of San Francisco trends and sort of what you've seen on San Francisco volumes over the last, call it, three months, six months? Thanks. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Let me take them in order. So, on Price Lock, it's rolled out nationally. It's rolled out nationally. Every single person in the country, as far as I know, has access to Price Lock. It's targeted at commuters. And so, when we do our internal targeting, so again, when we look at our daily volumes, about half of it, Monday to Friday is commute volume, which is a huge, huge deal. And you can imagine how frustrating it is for people to sort of wake up in the morning. And literally, people do this. I mean, if you talk to folks, in fact, as a driver, one of the people who got in my car a couple months ago was someone from Sausalito who literally said every morning she wakes up, basically if it costs $20, she'll take a Lyft, if it costs $30 bucks, she'll sort of think about it, but she'll still probably take a Lyft or the other guys if they're cheaper, which doesn't happen because guess what? Anyway, and then if it's $40 bucks, she'll drive herself, which she hates. And it was actually on a Friday morning, and she had cupcakes, all these sorts of things for a birthday, and she was kind of very happy that Lyft was priced well, so this is all before Price Lock came up. So, anyway, the product has really good product market fit because people don't like the variability, and it's -- and again it comes at a time which is particularly obnoxious, particularly in the morning when you need to get to work. One of the things we like about it is, aside from the four incremental rides that we've talked about, is it also gives drivers some certainty because we can use that as input to certain things we do in the background. And as a result, there's good marketplace management on this as well. And we know it's good because we can see that people who sign up for Price Lock tend to renew. So, it's a low churn. Now, again, it's still new, right? We're a couple of months in, but we like the dynamics we're seeing, which brings us back to go to market. You can expect within sort of economic guide rails that we will continue to promote it more and more and more because once people sign up, they don't tend to leave and they tend to take more rides, which is just obviously great sign all around. So, stay tuned for more, definitely early days, and that these features always take time to kind of get to any significant scale. But, but we like what we see and it will be a, certainly a nationwide product. On AVs in San Francisco, we're obviously looking at it quite closely. If you've been in San Francisco, you certainly see a lot of Waymo's around. You'll see Zoox around a little bit as well. They just announced last week -- Jesse, the CTO at Zoox, just announced that they'll be on the road soon in San Francisco. So, from a sort of density perspective, they're obviously working pretty hard. But when we look at companies like that, we really see them more as partners than as competitors. Of course, they're going to do some R&D, of course, they're going to want to understand customers directly, it makes all the sense in the world. But when we have discussions with all the partners that you would expect we're having with, it's really more around how can we partner to put these assets which are quite complicated to not just build obvious history, complex, but maintain on the road, keep repaired, keep charted, all these things. How can we play a role there? I'll say one last little thing, which is in San Francisco it's interesting. You see them a lot. What's also interesting to see, I'll just point this out, it's a little bit of a side, is you also see big parking lots with them, right? They have to stay somewhere. This is quite expensive as well. And it's also an interesting thing, this is super just random, but I was just reading this thing about hail and how hail hits cars pretty hard and causes repairs and all these sorts of things. So, it's really, my only point there is just the stuff that you're seeing at relatively small scale right now is super interesting and it's a good experience and the companies are doing a good job. But they're also realizing that they scale up to beyond hundreds to thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. Some of the problems are going to change and some of the issues they're going to confront are going to be quite different and we're super excited about partnering super deeply with them to help them with that. Brian Nowak -- Analyst Great. Thank you. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Ken Gawrelski -- Analyst Thanks so much. Two if I may. First, one more detailed one on insurance. Thank you for the guidance on the $50 million quarter over quarter on the cost of revenue side. Is there -- are there -- I just want to get a sense, are there any other differences in the cost of revenue line that we should be thinking about 3Q to 4Q, other than the routine stuff and the insurance? That's the first question. And the second one is more broad. As you think about next year in the domestic rideshare market, how do you think about pricing? And specifically, what I'm thinking about is you've got prime time likely continue to come down and you've talked about battling against that prime time and surge pricing and then you also have rider incentives and think about things like Price Lock. How -- should we think about synergy or any upside you get from decreases in kind of prime time be offset by other initiatives or how should we think about just overall your pricing strategy looking into next year? Thank you. Erin Brewer -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Ken. So, on the cost of revenues side, the answer to your question is no, there's nothing other of significance or that you should be considering in that line in terms of the changes I outlined from Q3 to Q4. With respect to pricing, let me kind of start, and I'll hover up just a little bit. Our goal is to operate in a healthy and competitive way. We've talked about that previously, right? Pricing competitive to the market. There's no change to that. No reason to think that there would be any change to that as you think about the future. I think another level set is the price of rider experiences is a combination of many, many factors. That includes mode mix, it includes a distance, it can also obviously include prime time depending on the supply conditions, a certain geography at a certain time. And so, our job -- and I think our results speak for themselves. We've been doing this really well, is to bring value to riders. And that means having a selection of modes that are going to meet use cases that are important. It means providing reliable pricing. We've talked a bit about Price Lock and then obviously prime time coming down is really, really beneficial to that. So, those are some of the, I think, foundational, if you will, theses as I think we would ask you to think about pricing. I won't talk about 2025 because I think it's, I don't have anything specific to say there. Maybe offering a little bit of color as you think about the third quarter, our gross bookings per ride was down Q on Q compared to what we saw in the second quarter. And that is influenced by prime time continuing to come down, as we've mentioned. But also seasonally, Q3 tends to be the highest quarter for bikes and scooters, right? Weather related. So, that's a pretty natural place for our gross bookings per ride to be lower. Q4, that seasonal mix shifts a bit, right? Q4 and Q1 in bikes and scooters. So, all else being equal, it's fair to assume that that gross booking per ride would increase primarily driven by the change of mix. But hopefully, that gives you some beneficial color on just how we think about pricing overall and some of the maybe more near-term dynamics. Ken Gawrelski -- Analyst Thank you so much. Erin Brewer -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Benjamin Black -- Analyst Great. Thank you for taking the questions. So, Erin, I guess contra revenue and consumer incentives, they were down 17% year on year. Can you just help us understand what the drivers of the outperformance were and how should those trend as we look ahead? And then I guess it's either for David or Erin, but can you just touch on the returns you are seeing on your consumer incentive investments? Are you generally seeing growing competition for active riders in the US and Canada? And how should we think about the durability of the current active rider growth? Thank you. Erin Brewer -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question. So, as a reminder, when we think about the deployment of incentives, it's really aligned with our broader strategy as a company. We make those investment trade-offs to keep the marketplace balanced, incredibly important. I'll also remind you that in 2024, we're running ahead of our Investor Day targets for 10% efficiencies on a combined basis. And at the same time, we've made really, really strong progress. David mentioned this in his prepared remarks, focusing on drivers, innovations like earnings commitment, or recent fall release that was just full of features that drivers love and attract more drivers to our platform. And this allows us to invest. So, you mentioned -- what are we seeing? I think if you look at our really strong progress, we've been talking about it now pretty much consistently each quarter in 2024, growing active riders, the growth in frequency, riders taking more rides on the Lyft platform, coming to the platform, and having a really, really good experience. So, those are some of the results for the year and sort of foundations about how we think about it, just to give you the specific data, because I know some of you get curious about this, that total incentive spend, and contra revenue and sales and marketing was about $274 million in the third quarter. That's about 6.7% of gross bookings and that's down sequentially from about 7% in the second quarter and is also in the third quarter really the lowest mark as a percentage of gross bookings in the last six quarters. So, absolutely driving efficiency there, and as we continue to build on the great momentum we've seen with drivers, it allows us to invest. So, you asked a little bit about maybe how we think about investing, etc., and what we're seeing in terms of outcomes. I'll do the how first because I think I've already talked about the outcomes in terms of growth in riders and frequency, etc. But we monitor that impact as we make those investments, whether it's a particular initiative around incremental rides or new riders or retention rates. It really depends on the nature of the incentive. But we monitor the efficiency of that incentive deployment. And we've been really leaning in because we're seeing great efficiency and really good outcomes in the way that those are deployed. So, hopefully, that's helpful. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Shweta Khajuria -- Analyst Thank you for taking my questions. Could you please talk about consumer sentiment in the quarter? There have been some mixed data points, but anything on resiliency of consumer spend and what specifically are you seeing in terms of maybe some of the drivers? And then the second question is just thoughts on your take rate and/or revenue margin in the near to midterm as you think about its trajectory, at least especially getting -- going into next year. Thanks a ton. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Hey, Shweta, it's David. I'll take the first, and Erin can take the second. So, we like what we see with consumer sentiment. We really do. And we look at this just like everybody does and try to sort of discern if there are things that are unusual or what have you. But I'll tell you a couple of data points that I think are interesting. So, first, we've already mentioned, so our biggest use cases can be, and that's going up and you would sort of expect that because of return to office and obviously Price Lock and some things that we're doing. The thing we might not expect would be that party time is actually our second biggest sort of Lyft and so to speak and a party time which we talked about is sort of a Friday and Saturday night thing and that's increased as well nicely, quite nicely. And I can give you a very specific example which is kind of fun. We've just been looking at Halloween data and our Halloween this year was just a monster just a monster and it was all-time high and sorry about that little choke there, kind of, sort of. But anyway, and then back a year ago, it was also a monster. So, in other words, we're lapping big increase year on year, and super interesting to see. So, that sort of suggests that that's discretionary, right? I mean, you don't have to go out on Halloween, and you certainly don't have to take a Lyft, but people are and people are. So, that suggests to us that what we're doing is working, that the service we're providing is landing with people, we're priced well, and so on and so on. So, we -- as Erin just kind of mentioned in a different context around pricing, we're very aware that in order to be a large-scale consumer brand, which we are, you have to have a value component. You just, you have to, right? I mean, there -- for all the people are doing well, there are people who are struggling or feeling frustrated. This is very real. So, so we're quite, so we look at wait and say, for example, our saving mode, sort of look at it very carefully and try to continue to make that product great. I always give a shoutout. I'm a little bit weird on this one, but to our bikes world, just because for so many people, it's a part of their daily lives, we give 250,000 rides a day roughly at peak. It's quite a large number and the per-ride cost is quite low. So, we sort of look up and down the stack all the way from the bottom to the top and the top being what we call HVMs, high-value mode. And we really see strength across the way, not a huge, nothing to worry about. So, I know there's a long way of saying, we're not seeing much, but maybe that gives you a little color on how we're looking at. Erin Brewer -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And, Shweta, on your question on revenue margins. So, the revenue margin trends that we've seen in 2024, and it's absolutely true for Q3 as well, reflect the efficiency that I was mentioning a few questions ago in terms of overall incentive spend and the strong progress that we're seeing there. But also, I would remind you in particular in the third quarter, there is a mix impact on the revenue margin from our bikes and scooters business. So, different from our rideshare business, the bikes and scooters flow through pretty much one-to-one from gross bookings to revenue. So, in the quarters where we've got more volume, that's going to have a larger impact. And so, for example, in the third quarter, that was about 2.5 points attributed to the mix of the bikes and scooters mode. So, hopefully, that gives you some additional color. Shweta Khajuria -- Analyst Yes. Thank you very much, both of you. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Erin Brewer -- Chief Financial Officer We're ready for the next question. Operator, we're ready for the next question. Operator John Blackledge, your line is open. John Blackledge -- Analyst Great. Thanks. Two questions. Any further color on how the Canada business performed in the third quarter, and then discuss the continued expansion in Canada? And then secondly, on Lyft Media, if you can give maybe some color on the revenue run rate trend in 3Q and I think Erin mentioned investing in ad tech, any color there would be helpful. Thank you. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Hey, John. I'll touch on both briefly. So, Canada, and I think we've probably said all these things publicly before, but I'll reiterate that we're very much on track. In Canada, our goal is to double ride volume year on year, and we're on track. And it's great. It's great. We literally are, Canada seems just killing it. Super good to see how strong the product market fit is, and something we're paying a lot of attention to. I mentioned that Toronto is now our sixth biggest market. That's the greater Toronto area, which is wonderful. I forget what it was a year ago, but I can tell you it wasn't in the top 10. That's for sure. So, liking what we're seeing there, good momentum, good product market fit, more to come for sure. And then on Lyft Media, we were again on track, we've put out some goals. I think we've talked about a run rate that we're very much on the path for this year. Really, I would say the focus now just to sort of maybe one click deeper on that is, people are -- and I, some of this again, a little bit big picture for a sec but like marketers brands are always looking for new ways to get to their customers, they just always are. And sometimes again, I look sort of very big picture at this and think of build pamphlets back in the late 1800s, billboards on the highways, interstates, came up and then radio again, very car-focused, also home-focused and TV, so forth. The thing that's different now, of course, is not just the online-ness of everyone, which is kind of obvious, but that the people with first-party data really tend to do well. And we have first-party data, right? Every time you get in a car as a rider, you're telling us a lot about yourself, right? You're saying, where are you coming from? Where are you going to? What's your intention? Are you going to a coffee shop? Are you going to a bookstore, a drugstore, a pharmacy? Any number of things. And that's first-party data. And so, to the extent we can create tailored experiences for our riders, who by the way tend to spend about 17 minutes in the car or a little bit more, they tend to check their app out several times, up to seven times to see whether they're there yet. All this provides a real platform for great media opportunities. So, we continue to be, again, as we always say, it's still quite early days. I mentioned earlier that we're really in kind of a foundational mode now where we're in particular really focusing on measurability because of how important marketing efficiency is to every marketer out there. But we're very enthusiastic about what we see, and we like -- the video ad unit is still relatively new, and see maybe yourself, maybe you'll see an ad trip or a movie trailer if you open up the Lyft app. Anyway, long way of saying we like what we see on track to the sort of statements we made about the exit run rate for this year, and I'm itching for more. John Blackledge -- Analyst Thank you. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Unknown speaker -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi. This is David on for Mark. I wanted to follow up with an AV question. You talked about AVs as a TAM expander. I'm just wondering, are there any specific use cases where you think riders might prefer an AV ride over a regular ride, and any early signals from what you're seeing competitively in San Francisco that might inform that? David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Hey, David. I honestly would say it's probably too early for us to have real insight there. I mean, certainly remember, we've given about 130,000 rides, primarily in Las Vegas over the years. So, we have a sense from that. But of course, Las Vegas is a very particular use case. And that's kind of its own world. And then we're looking very closely and monitoring what's happening here on the ground. And we see it in San Francisco. We see it obviously in Phoenix as well. We see it in Texas. So, kind of looking at it, I wouldn't say there's anything dramatic that we've seen, maybe nothing worth really talking about just yet. It's also a little bit of a funny thing right now because now it's a couple of things that's happening. So, partially there's this novelty thing, and tourism is a big driver actually if you see in San Francisco. In fact, literally, someone on our team just said that they get their parents arrived when they were here, so in an AV. So, the sort of tourism effect from the novelty effect probably swamps other things. And then again, I'll just say it again. It's also a very curated experience right now. I mean, on the on the ground here in San Francisco, these are literally Jaguars. They're driving people around. So, that's a nice experience. Tomorrow's AV experience will be quite different as they show up on all sorts of different models and makes and so forth. So, anyway, that maybe gives you a sense that, like, I think we're very much in monitoring and we're super excited about our partnerships we just announced. I think, in particular, May Mobility will be very interesting. That'll be at Atlanta, that's next year, that's Toyota Siennas. That'll give us more insight. So, we're all kind of in learning mode, but I don't think we can draw any strong conclusions right now in part because it's just so novel. Unknown speaker -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Got it. Thank you, David. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steven Choi with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Choi -- Analyst OK. Great. Thank you so much. So, David, I think the default thought process right now is that Lyft will be an asset-light partner for the fleet owners of AVs, but should we be thinking about you potentially taking a more direct role, either in fleet maintenance or management? Does that come up in discussions with potential new partners at all? And second, as the active rider base gets larger, I mean, I would imagine that growth will decelerate, given the large numbers. So, in order to get to the longer-term booking targets, you need to drive frequency higher as an offset. So, can you talk about what your latest data is telling you about cohort behavior? Maybe how is your rider's age, the activity picks up meaningfully so that the average usage right now is about three per month, but the gap between the newer cohorts versus older cohorts, any sort of color you can provide there in terms of the overall level of activity as your customers become more used to using you. Thank you. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll give a couple thoughts there. And, Erin, of course, if you have things to add in as well, let's go back and forth on this. I think -- so I think your premise on the AV side -- I think your premise is right. Asset-light is -- that's how we run our business for sure. And it's really worth just remarking on that. I mean, again, 1.4 million drivers on the platform, but they own their own cars, which is quite a good thing, certainly helps us a lot. That'd be a lot of capital to have to deploy. So, anyway, we certainly consider that to be very core to the model for sure. I think when we talk about things like maintenance and service and so forth, that's not an area where we need to do that ourselves. And I'll maybe give you a tiny bit again, more insight into that. Our Flexdrive subsidiary, which does own a relatively small number of cars, but that's through the subsidiary, it's kind of done -- they allow people who maybe don't want to use their primary car for rideshare or maybe don't have a primary car. It's also good for us because it's kind of good R&D we can kind of get direct exposure to it for drivers through the subsidiary. But even when they do things like service and maintenance and so forth and so on, it's much more around service level agreements with other with other partners, right, with people who are expert at repairs and maintenance and what have you. And to go just peel back the onion one layer more, a lot of the software we have built allows us to make sure, for example, that those SLAs are being met. So, if you know you've got to change out a catalytic converter, whatever it might be, then you know that costs a certain amount and you know that that takes a certain amount of time, and we have a lot of data on that which we've developed over the years. And so, as a result, we can track very carefully and make sure that that's being done to spec and being done within SLA and so on so forth. So, a lot of the work that we do is kind of on the management side. That's why we call it fleet management rather than the operations side. So, we're not going to be building or buying Lyfts, and I don't mean Lyfts that way. I mean like Lyfts as you would find in a garage like that. So, no, so asset-light for sure. But the network and the fleet management capacity that we've built is extraordinarily important. And then you asked another question, and unfortunately, I got so excited about that. Steven Choi -- Analyst User growth versus frequency growth. Yeah. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, for sure. Yeah, so when we said this at Investor Day, typically we really look at it as kind of a 50-50 thing, right, new riders versus and also increasing frequency. I'll remind you that as proud as we are, and with, I think, legitimacy about our 800 million rides a year, roughly 2 million rides a day, obviously growing at a nice clip, just as a reminder, that compares to 160 billion rides that people take in their private vehicles, personal vehicles every year, just in the United States. So, I would say in terms of our penetration of the use cases and riders, we're still -- it's almost negligible, really, when you think of all the different times that people are driving around today versus the number of times they're taking rideshare. Even if you add in our competitor, it's still, I mean, now, OK, now it's two times zero. So, I think there's a lot more. So, I wouldn't say that we're anywhere close to penetrating on that side. I will absolutely say that we're certainly focused on increasing frequency among existing riders, but we want to do it first and foremost by providing great service. That's the single best way, single best way. And I think if you -- we're not confused about that. So, our customer obsession strategy is very focused on providing a level of service that will encourage people to come back. There's a great Walt Disney quote that I can tell you about another time. But anyway, we're very focused on increasing rates that way. Steven Choi -- Analyst Thank you. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Operator And that's all the time we have for questions today. And now, I would like to turn the call back to David Risher, CEO, for closing remarks. David Risher -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much, everyone. Look, I know everyone's busy, particularly today. There's a lot going on in the world, but we're super excited about what we've achieved, but also really what lies ahead, and are looking forward to connecting with our investor community. I have a little bit of news here. We'll be out in LA, New York, London, San Francisco over the next few weeks and we actually plan to further ramp up our outreach in 2025. So, please do reach out if you'd like to connect with any of us. We look forward to talking to you. Thanks for your interest and your curiosity, everything you do to help us be as good as we possibly can. And we will connect with you another time. Thank you.

operator, ready take questions. question & answers: operator thank you. begin question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] ask limit one question, additional questions, please requeue. first question come line doug anmuth jpmorgan. please go ahead. doug anmuth -- analyst thanks taking questions. two, one david, one erin. david, hoping could talk benefit seeing less prime time surge platform that's showing term ride volume via frequency retention. know mentioned higher conversion. wondering there's way quantify benefit there. then, erin, talk $650 million free cash flow 2024? want make sure understand driver significantly higher outlook function shift 1p captive, think trend '25 sustainability? thanks. david risher -- chief executive officer sure. doug, start pas erin. so, first, prime time. yeah, prime time sucks. so, really trying focus bringing down. heard, 40% year year, awesome. so, find look market market area get fastest see incursion ride growth -- inversion ride growth increase nicely. so, think mentioned chicago prepared remarks. boston's actually another city seeing work super well. so, great, great. -- maybe liken little bit starbucks' move last week getting rid stupid surcharge oat milk stuff. like, nobody like it. nobody like kind variability, particularly charged something expect. put slightly broader frame say, look frequency, continues increase, frequency driven primarily great service. right? better service likely take another ride. that's just, mean, tautological. there's certain thing do, like price lock thing actually increase frequency even that. so, prime time, fall right middle that, right? that's providing great service also providing consistency. so, sort put together, really liking see. think conversion actually increased. number's gotten better 0.1 percentage point. so, seeing good increase there. course, average kind different things. so, that's sort big picture that. then, erin? erin brewer -- chief financial officer yeah. sure, doug. cash flow, kind start hovering little bit here. first all, incredibly proud performance team able drive across business, obviously strengthening operating efficiency improving margins. given relatively low kind capex profile business, modeling perspective, assume significant portion adjusted ebitda convert cash. course, considering impact insurance. so, let kind talk dynamic seeing year dynamic mentioned third quarter. so, first function insurance accruals, bit higher growth bit higher expectations. so, that's one part. second part lower cash payout. so, let spend second here, chatting that. accrue expense period, expect total payout particular cohort take approximately seven year resolve, peak usually happening year three majority claim paying sort year one three think overall horizon. so, today example, fair assume majority claim paying 2021 2023 time period course ride volume lower therefore fewer claims, therefore reduction cash outflows. asked little bit mean longer term. so, looking ahead, think near-term phase lrp, think fair assume conversion near-term, say, 2025 part, would bit higher 90%, likely high seeing 2024. move outer year lrp, would expect dynamic normalize insurance-related accrual cash payment would little bit balanced. so, longer term, believe 90% plus adjusted ebitda conversion target appropriate. doug anmuth -- analyst great. thank both. operator next question come line eric sheridan goldman sachs. please go ahead. eric sheridan -- analyst thanks much taking question, really two-parter. think new partnership announcing doordash supply side autonomous vehicle companies, think doordash, think driving demand rider ride side term underlying assumption might contribute incremental growth? term autonomous, maybe refresh u view adding autonomous supply partnering across autonomous vehicle industry landscape might alter see term growth prospect margin prospect going forward. thanks much. david risher -- chief executive officer sure. let take -- two chunky ones. so, -- talk partnership avs, maybe erin talk little bit unit economics av well. kind tag team little bit this. yeah, maybe not. see. see, cover. so, partnerships, doordash, super interesting, right? so, got 18 million dashpass holder worldwide 18 million customer worldwide. think dashpass holders, right? anyway -- that's big number. obviously lyft users, maybe smaller number might expect. so, think absolutely right, eric, sort target top line this. effectively rider acquisition, right? acquire rider way that's super customer-friendly? know people like take ride go out, come home, get something delivered. so, great start. give many details. say partnership tend to, sort take time build. so, let's get ahead ourselves. certainly like see far. see rider responding it. signing link account maybe ordering something maybe taking ride taken otherwise. so, yep, great think top-line driver something that's going unfold time, like see far sure. avs, one, mind, going sort zoom second. mean, asked specifically additional supply, actually want give little bit context something talked much far. so, first thing say av is, av great. great, right? good experience. see street san francisco. clear, bespoke experience right now. expensive car. kind thing going behind scene make sure work super well. scale quite small grand scheme things. really interesting experience. so, absolutely see tam expander us, right, bring additional supply bring new experience rider rider like, maybe others choose much. so, idea hybrid two them, human-driven car robot-driven car super exciting us. strategy become partner choice av stakeholder. might oem, equipment manufacturer, number things. one basic reason, want best way keep av utilized therefore making money. that's sort thing. like, expensive assets, going expensive long time. so, got moving around, right? like airplane restaurant's got people seat airplane got sky, like, thing utilized. so, going break little bit, sorry long answer -- kind chunky area. so, first demand generation. so, three big pillars, going think about. first demand gen, right? so, know this. mean, one two big, scaled platform north america, 40 million active riders, two main ride day. so, think sort stand reason. second place marketplace management so, 1.4 million driver today platform every year. that's lot individuals. do? rely u today for? sort fast forward think av going rely u tomorrow for? well, got onboarded, got insured, got get paid, got get matched, right? 24 hour day, seven day week. car get matched riders, mean estimate eta, that's pickup time, got price right, got customer care thing left car. marketplace, got manage pickup drop off, sound easy, address fifth avenue, secretly around corner, sort things. so, marketplace management quite complicated, something massive scale every single day. second piece, second big pillar av asset vendor going want plug into. third fleet utilization. ok, actually little bit subtle. sound straightforward, actually quite complex. again, course, onboarding, thing like maintenance. again, think car asset. again, reason, least find actually easy think airplane expensive asset make sure flying around sitting maintenance stock forth. so, think car need answer maintenance, right, need recharged. need get paid time, maybe insure policy issues, customer care issues, stuff. so, past four year flexdrive subsidiary ton this, ton this. flexdrive acquires, leases, manages, maintains, repairs, resells, ten thousand car every single year rideshare company capability in-house, say again. rideshare company ability house. way, good going brag behalf flexdrive folks. achieve 90% utilization course year, industry-leading. ok, put together think see av exciting us. new form supply, say sort tactically like that. blend nicely driver-driven cars, right? choose one other, both. capability put use. putting use, make stakeholder money, great. that's going choose u again. so, think sort one pieces. think sort whole great parts. probably enough av right now. and, erin, want add anything that? erin brewer -- chief financial officer no, nailed term -- think there's lot great work done fold period time. cost asset, regulatory insurance environment, etc. bottom line, said, asset utilization going incredibly important unit economics. david risher -- chief executive officer thanks, eric. operator next question come line brian nowak morgan stanley. please go ahead. brian nowak -- analyst thanks taking questions. two. first one price lock, good early signal adoption frequency bump. wanted ask about, walk u sort go-to-market strategy using this?

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead. Michael Steele -- Vice President, Investor Relations Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's second quarter earnings conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially and we refer you to the factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of this slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales performance are year-on-year and on a constant currency basis. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our chief executive officer; and Nathan Winters, our chief financial officer. Bill will begin with a discussion of our second quarter results. Nathan will then provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our third quarter and revised full year outlook. Bill will conclude with progress on advancing our strategic priorities. Following the prepared remarks, Bill and Nathan will take your questions. Now, let's turn to Slide 4, as I hand it over to Bill. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our teams executed well in the second quarter delivering sales and earnings results above the high end of our outlook. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1.2 billion approximately flat to the prior year. An adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.5%, a 70 basis point decrease, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.18, a 3% decrease from the prior year. As we discussed in our last earnings call, during the first quarter, we began to see modest recovery in retail and e-commerce. In the second quarter, we saw signs of momentum across other end markets, including healthcare, where we realized double-digit growth. Mobile computing returned to growth across each of our vertical end markets led by healthcare and retail. The growth in mobile computing was offset by declines across our other major product categories where year-on-year comparisons are more challenging and we were in earlier stages of recovery. Services and software saw modest growth in the quarter. While we are encouraged by early momentum and demand, we continue to see cautious spending behavior from our customers on large deployments which have not yet returned to historical levels. Another highlight was our sequential improvement in profitability due to improved gross margin and the benefits of our restructuring actions. Our plan to deliver $120 million of net annualized operating savings is on track and substantially complete. Given our second quarter performance, progress in our cost actions, and early signs of momentum and demand, we are raising our full year outlook for sales and profitability. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results and discuss our revised 2024 outlook. Nathan Andrew Winters -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, total company sales were approximately flat, reflecting early signs of momentum demand beyond retail and e-commerce. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment declined 14.4%, primarily driven by printing and RFID on challenging prior year comparisons. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 8.2% with double-digit growth in mobile computing partially offset by a decline in data capture solutions. We saw modest growth in services and software. Performance was mixed across our regions. In North America, sales decreased 7% with fewer large orders in retail and transportation and logistics, partially offset by strong growth in healthcare. In EMEA, sales increased 10%, driven by mobile computing. In Asia-Pacific, sales declined 3% with continued weakness in China and challenging compares in Australia and Japan, partially offset by growth in Southeast Asia. And sales increased 7% in Latin America led by Brazil. From a sequential perspective, total Q2 sales were slightly higher than Q1, with growth in nearly all product categories as we realized modest improvement in demand throughout the quarter in manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation and logistics. Adjusted gross margin increased 60 basis points to 48.6% as we benefited from cycling premium supply chain costs in the prior year in favorable effects. Adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales increased 110 basis points. This was driven by normalized incentive compensation expense partially offset by approximately $25 million of incremental net savings from our restructuring actions. This resulted in second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.5%, a 70 basis point decrease versus the prior year, and a 60 basis point sequential improvement from Q1. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.18, a 3.3% year-over-year decrease. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. In the first half of 2024, we generated $389 million of free cash flow as we drove improvements in working capital. We ended the quarter at a 2.4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is within our target range and we had approximately $1.5 billion of capacity on a revolving credit facility as of quarter end. We diversified our capital structure during the second quarter by issuing $500 million of senior unsecured notes, while retiring a receivable financing facility that matured in May. We also terminated our remaining interest rate swap agreements for $77 million of cash proceeds. We have been prioritizing debt pay down and now have increased flexibility given our lower debt balance and improved cash flow. Let's now turn to our outlook. For Q3, we expect sales growth between 25% and 28% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes continued stability of demand trends across our major product categories with broad-based growth as we cycle easier compares across the business, including significant destocking activity by our distributors during the second half of last year. We entered the third quarter with a solid backlog and pipeline of opportunities. That said, we are not anticipating an increase in large order activity considering the conversion rates on our pipeline remain lower than historical levels as customers continue to be cautious in what remains an uncertain environment. We would like to see additional momentum in large orders before factoring in a stronger recovery. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin is now expected to be between 20% and 21%, driven by expense leveraging from higher sales volume with benefits from restructuring actions partially offset by normalized incentive compensation expense. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3 to $3.30. We have raised our guide for the full year, reflecting our second quarter performance and early signs of momentum and demand. We now expect sales growth between 4% and 7% for the year and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $12.30 to $12.90. Free cash flow for the year is now expected to be at least $700 million. We have been making progress rightsizing inventory in our balance sheet and improving cash conversion. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Nathan. Zebra is well-positioned to benefit from secular trends that support our long-term growth. These include labor and resource constraints, track and trace mandates, increased consumer expectations, and the need for real time supply chain visibility. We help our customers digitize their environments and automate their workflows through our comprehensive portfolio of innovative solutions, including purpose-built hardware, software, and services. We empower frontline workers to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in real-time through advanced capabilities including automation, prescriptive analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. At our innovation day event in May, we demonstrated how we transform workflows across the supply chain to drive positive outcomes for enterprises across our end market. Our products and solutions are mission critical to enable visibility that consumers and enterprises now expect throughout the entire supply chain. On Slide 11, you will see Zebra solutions can touch a product 30 times from its origination to the point of last mile delivery. Let's briefly walk through the journey with a few high level exams. In manufacturing, our machine vision solutions provide quality inspection and track and trace visibility throughout the process. In a warehouse, our wearable mobile computers, autonomous mobile robots and comprehensive RFID portfolio transform receiving, picking and shipping. As the product arrives at a store, associates are equipped with Zebra software running on our mobile computers to assist customers' stock inventory and fulfill online orders. And when an item is delivered to your home, you receive a notification and picture from Zebra's handheld device verifying on time quality delivery. As you'll see on Slide 12, our customers leverage our solutions to optimize workflows across a broad range of end markets. We empower enterprises to drive productivity and better serve their customers, shoppers, and patients. We are seeing Zebra's competitive differentiation in mobile computing solutions drive wins across our vertical end markets. Customers value the capabilities we embed in the software layer of our devices that they leverage to transform workflows and improve outcome. For example, we secured a mobile computing win with the commercial airline utilizing our mobile package dimensioning solution enabled through AI. Also, a North American retailer will leverage Zebra's work cloud collaboration software on their new wearable mobile computers, connecting their associates to drive better outcomes in their stores. Additionally, we are able to displace consumer cellphones at a European retailer with our mobile computers and Zebra's Identity Guardian solution. It provides multifactor authentication for a shared device environment that brings security, productivity, and convenience to the front line. It is also notable that mobile computing contributed to double-digit sales growth in healthcare. Over the past year, our teams have been successfully selling the benefits of our solutions and clinical mobility that empower caregivers while delivering lower total cost of ownership for hospital systems. We have been displacing consumer cellphones with our devices and there continues to be a long runway of opportunity for equipping more clinicians with mobile computers. In closing, we expect to see broad-based growth in the second half as we cycle much easier comparisons and benefit from momentum beyond retail. We maintain strong conviction in our long-term opportunity for Zebra as we elevate our strategic role with our customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions. Our sales and cost initiatives have positioned us well for profitable growth as our end markets continue to recover. I will now hand it back to Mike. Michael Steele -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone a chance to participate. Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead. Damian Karas -- Analyst Hey, good morning, everyone. Congrats on the quarter. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Damian. Damian Karas -- Analyst Bill, I wanted to get your thoughts on what you suspect it's going to take to bring some of the larger project activity back into the fold, and maybe you could just give us a sense on, it sounds like you're not expecting much this year. How much upside to your guidance do you think there would be if you do in fact start to see a return sooner rather than later? Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, Damian, I think that if we look back to Q1, we saw early signs of recovery, as we talked about last quarter in retail and e-commerce. We're certainly encouraged by the better than expected sales results in Q2, which really, we saw momentum, as we said around beyond retail really. And really, it was driven by mid-tier and run rate business. So large deal activity was pretty consistent in Q2 coming off of Q1, but still well below historic levels. So I think that we see customers overall continue to cite uncertainty to us in the market, their markets, their end markets, which really is reflecting in their purchasing behavior. I'd say that large deployments overall are being spread more to these mid-size deals or smaller deals, and being spread out over a longer period of time because of this, and I think ultimately, when they're placing small orders, they're placing those to add to their installed base or for new applications or expansion opportunities to-date. So I think that the pipeline of opportunities remains strong. I think there's optimism on the part of our partners and customers. I think we'd like to see more momentum in large orders. So we saw the first uptick in large orders in the first quarter kind of flat the second quarter. So we feel OK about that. We saw growth in mid-tier and run rate. I just think we'd like to see more large order activity to call a broader base recovery. So I think now we're seeing strength in mobile computing, strength across kind of large orders, medium and small. But we just want to see more large orders really from our customers. And I think it's just driven by their caution of what's happening in macro today. Damian Karas -- Analyst Great. That makes sense. And I just want to ask you on the cost front, it seems like there's been a pick back up in shipping rates, and I know that was a little bit of a headwind for you guys in past years. To what extent have you been maybe experiencing some of that cost inflation and maybe just talk through what's kind of in your guidance for the rest of the year? Thanks. Nathan Andrew Winters -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Damian, so we have seen a modest increase in rates due to whether that's some of the Red Sea issues or now with the stronger demand, particularly on the ocean rates. I'd say it's a modest impact in terms of incremental costs that we've included in our full year guide. But the team's again working several actions in terms of the different air modes, how we leverage cost off to improve transit time, as well as again working with our partners around the forecast for the remainder of year to get ahead of that, the second half demand and mitigate as much of that as possible. So there is absolutely seeing some increase, but I'd say it's pretty modest at this point and within our second half guide. Operator The next question comes from Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Jamie Cook -- Analyst Hi. Good morning and congratulations on a nice quarter. I guess, just my first question, I guess, what struck me in the quarter, your EVM margins were much better than I thought, and I think even better than your expectations. I think you were guiding to down margin sequentially. So can you just speak to the drivers behind that? I guess, that's my first question. And then, I'll stop there and then I'll give you my second question after, I guess. Nathan Andrew Winters -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Jamie. So, yes, if you look at overall gross margins at 48.6%, this is our highest gross margin quarter in three years, benefiting from the level of large deals. So the strength in run rate and mid-tier is a positive for gross margin in particular within the EVM segment. We're also seeing continued strength in our service and software margins again, which is heavily less more weighted toward EVM, as well as now fully rolling over all the premium supply chain costs. So again, I think it was part of that was just the strength in the quarter and really seeing the incremental volume fall through to the bottom line, driving the sequential improvement in gross margin both within EVM particularly. Jamie Cook -- Analyst OK. And then, I guess, just given the strength in the margin this quarter, and I mean, I don't think your EBITDA margin guide is now, what 20% to 21%, I think before it was about 20%. I'm just wondering why we wouldn't see better pull-through in the back half of the year, in particular with the top-line growth that you would see relative to declines or flat revenues in the second quarter. Nathan Andrew Winters -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. If you look at our EBITDA guide for the third quarter of 20% to 21% again year-on-year, that's up primarily due to volume leverage, nearly nine points. And I think we expect similar deal, as well as business mix Q2 to Q3 such that you get a similar margin profile from Q2 to Q3. So if you look at the Q3 guide, effectively flat to Q2 based on that assumption of kind of the underlying mix of deals, as well as the business unit mix gives us that similar profile. And I'd say the other really don't expect the same level of incremental benefits sequentially as we were able to realize some of the incremental benefits in Q2 from the restructuring actions. And then, you do see that modest uptick implied in the guide for the fourth quarter on the incremental volume. Operator The next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead. Tommy Moll -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Nathan Andrew Winters -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Tommy. Tommy Moll -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst First question on the large order activity. At this point where we're nearly through July, how fully baked are your customer budgets for this year? And at what point does the large deal conversation really start to become one centered around 2025, when a lot of the customer budgets are refreshed? Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer I think that, Tommy, I'd say that customers continue to scrutinize their budgets even as we're well into the year, right? And I think that some of those have to do with, in the past, we've seen kind of year-end spending from our customers, but I think that the uncertainty around the economy is still kind of weighing on them in large deployments and what will happen in kind of second half of year here. So I think that we typically not have visibility quite yet into whether there'll be year-end spending by our customers. We're talking about certainly a pipeline of opportunities that they see. And then, the question is, do they move ahead with those in late 2024 or into 2025. I think that from a macro perspective, whether it's interest rates or presidential election or manufacturing production, all those shipping parcel, parcels, shipments have just started to inch up and turn to more positive volumes or growth in volume. So I think all those kind of weighing on their business, and I think there's even though they've got budgets, it's kind of the reluctance to move ahead with those, really because of the macro factors overall. And I think that we'd expect those to continue to kind of stabilize. They can get more confidence in their business and then abate as we get into kind of second half year and into 2025. But I'd say, overall, many discussions with our customers regarding projects; it's really about just taking longer to kind of move those forward still. Now, again, we saw a large order activity about flat Q1 to Q2 overall, and we saw this pickup in mid-tier run rates. So these are all positive signs. Growth outside of retail, which we really saw in first quarter into a broader segment. Mobile computing was the first to decline and the first to return to growth we expected that. So I think everything's moving in the right direction. So I think that -- I think our customers just don't know for kind of year-end 2024 and into 2025, but we're optimistic, I would say, that everything's moving in the right direction. Tommy Moll -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst And Bill, just from a competitive standpoint, is there anything that you've sensed having changed particularly in a large deal context where you've seen other market participants perhaps become more aggressive on price or whatever other factor? Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. No, I would say that really the competitive environment hasn't changed a lot. Overall, we're certainly continuing to maintain share in the marketplace. We feel good about our differentiation that we bring to the marketplace with the depth and breadth of our solutions, our competitive advantages, scale, technology, leadership, our partner community, our go-to-market, our relationships with our customers. So the large deal, phenomenon not coming, not returned to historic levels is not really about Zebra. It's truly about the market. And we don't really see any mark change from a competitive perspective. We're always going to have competitors out there, large and small, and then that continues to be the case. So nothing there. And we feel good about our market position and continue to win in the market. Operator And the next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Joseph Giordano -- Analyst Hey, guys. Good morning. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Nathan Andrew Winters -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Joe. Joseph Giordano -- Analyst Bill, you had mentioned, I guess, it was last quarter that distributors were asking for more product than you were willing to sell because, but you were hesitant because you wanted to make sure you understood where it was going and try to prevent a future buildup of inventory that then needs to get liquidated again. Like, what's the update on that? Have you kind of started to give them what they're requesting? Nathan Andrew Winters -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Joe. This is Nathan. I can take that. I'd say overall, the global channel inventory as we look at it from days on hand is still at a normalized level. I think you have pockets around the world, where there's still a little bit of rebalancing both driving down inventory in the channel, as well as where there's incremental needs. And I think similar to where we were last quarter, it's working with each one of those partners across the region to ensure that they have the appropriate level of inventory for the demand they're expecting and that we see in the pipeline. So again, it remains very collaborative. I'd say similar position where we were in Q1, where there's always some that want a little bit more. And again, just trying to make sure we have the right amount in the channel to support our end users, but not getting ahead of ourselves, given some of the uncertainty that we've talked about. Joseph Giordano -- Analyst Fair enough. And then, just if I could ask on some of your smaller businesses, can you give us an update on trends within like RFID and with Matrox and Fetch and maybe how you see those businesses in terms of like growth in size exiting this year? Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. I can take that, Joe. I'd say, RFID challenging kind of second quarter on compares from cycling large opportunities a year ago. I would say that overall would expect return to growth in second half year. We're continue to -- we move into the second half really with strong backlog and pipeline of opportunities across not just retail but transportation, logistics, manufacturing. So we're seeing continued use cases across RFID, including moving beyond apparel to general merchandise inside retail. Clearly track and trace across the supply chain, parcel tracking within T&L, baggage tracking within airlines, so lots of opportunities across RFID. I would say machine vision. We continue to be excited about the opportunity within machine vision, challenging market at the moment. And our Matrox acquisition, when we acquired that asset, we knew was heavily weighted toward semiconductor equipment manufacturing, which is still a challenge segment as well. So decline in the quarter in machine vision, but we feel good about it overall. We saw strength in our Adaptive Vision acquisition. So software -- machine vision software in the quarter that was a bright spot. I'd say that the diversification of that business, which was our focus all along with the Matrox business diversify into areas like automotive and logistics into new areas. We also had our organic investment in machine vision, which really applies more to logistics area. That diversification is going well. Ultimately, we're calling on more customers. We're seeing more opportunities. We're continuing to invest in go-to-market across the globe in just seeing more opportunities is across machine vision. So we feel good about that in a great opportunity for Zebra overall. I'd say software -- our software assets, we're seeing the combination of our mobile devices, especially in the wearable space now with some of our assets in software that we're pretty excited about. So the word cloud solutions really focus on retail and then leveraging our mobile device in the hands of retail associates. And we continue to advance and bring those solutions together and combine that with things like wearable mobile computing. We've seen some early wins there. So we feel good about the portfolio. They're a smaller segment of the market, right, or, sorry, our not market, meaning smaller segment of our business overall or piece of our business. So really mobile computing returning to growth, other segments being more challenged. These are areas that we see as driving the future growth of Zebra. Operator The next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. Please go ahead. Andrew Buscaglia -- Analyst Hey. Good morning, guys. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Nathan Andrew Winters -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning. Andrew Buscaglia -- Analyst Yes. So I want to get your thoughts on potential upgrades of devices, especially in 2025. Do you have any data you can share around the age of your installed base? Because presumably a lot of these devices were sold during COVID and we should start to see a natural need to upgrade these in the next year, I would think. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer I'd say overall we're, from a mobile computing perspective, I'd say that our customers have really been absorbing the capacity that they've built out during the pandemic more than anything else. So I think there's clearly continued upgrade cycles across all of our customers. But from the idea that they built out so much capacity during the pandemic that they're using that capacity today, and then as the economy slowed, that created even more capacity, so they're ever using that capacity off, I think we're seeing customers move into the idea that they've absorbed some of the capacity and are beginning to buy again. But that's kind of early signs of what we're seeing. I'd say that there's a solid pipeline of opportunities for mobile computing overall, both in kind of refresh new use cases continue to add to the number of devices inside our customer base. And we continue to see competitive wins across the portfolio. So I think the upgrades are out there, the refreshers are out there, and ultimately some customers are sweating assets a bit more, others are leveraging what they have today. And I think that we're confident that as the macro environment gets better, our customers will continue to upgrade our devices and we'll see an uptick in large orders within our business, which will marry with what we're seeing as kind of medium in run rate business growing in second quarter. Andrew Buscaglia -- Analyst Yes. OK. OK. And then, you're raising your free cash flow expectations again and just kind of given where we are things looking to start to improve, and you probably have some confidence here. Where do you see capital allocation going into the year-end? Is M&A -- will see some M&A come to fruition before year-end? Or is there a focus more on share repurchase? Or how are you thinking about things? Nathan Andrew Winters -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So I think on the first part, again, please raise the guide for free cash flow to over $700 million, including the final settlement, as well as the swap sale in the second quarter. So -- and the improvement overall in working capital to get us above the 100% free cash flow conversion. And as you say, the -- really the prior -- we've prioritized debt paydown as well working on our capital structure in the first half of the year. So ending the second quarter just under our below the target range of two and a half times debt leverage, and that will sequentially improve as we move through the year. I think in terms of overall priority, they remain unchanged. The first is organic growth getting the business back to the growth trajectory we need it to be and want it to be along with the right profitability levels. M&A continues to be a lever. And I think now with the improved cash flow, as well as our overall capital structure, we have additional flexibility for share repurchases as we move through the year. So Bill, you want to touch on the M&A brochure? Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. I guess, I'd say that our M&A philosophy really remains unchanged. I think we continue to leverage M&A where it makes sense to advance our vision and our overall strategy. I'd say in the short-term, the bar is probably higher based on kind of macro uncertainty and then higher interest rates. But I would say that we continue to target select assets that ultimately are closely adjacent and synergistic to our business today. As Nate said, we've got a strong balance sheet and flexibility to continue to look at companies and we continue to be inquisitive. But the bar is higher at the moment. Operator And the next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall -- Analyst Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of questions, just on the healthcare strength that you saw. I know that that had been a relatively they had been in a more challenged spend environment. So just wondering, how broad-based that is. Is that kind of new project based or just any detail there? And then, second question, EMEA looked like a source of strength for you guys. I think we've seen that across some other companies. And so, is that a matter of, they're just coming from a very depressed environment. And so, we're coming off of a lower base and that's where some of the EMEA strength is. Are you -- are there any trends in EMEA that you think are worth calling out? Thanks. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. So I'll start with healthcare and then jump to EMEA. Healthcare, I'd say overall, mobile computing drove the growth in healthcare. It really is our team's focus on clinical mobility and really total cost of ownership. We've seen in the past a significant number of consumer devices used in that space. And I think that we're seeing healthcare systems realize that the total cost of ownership of Zebra devices is well-positioned for them in an environment of tighter budgets and thinner margins overall within healthcare. And we add a lot of value, ultimately by improving productivity of healthcare workers, getting data into electronic medical record systems, and then ultimately enhancing patient safety overall. So I think the automating of workflows, the digitizing the information around assets and patients and staff is of value that our healthcare customers are seeing. I think a medium to longer-term opportunity we're now seeing is things like home healthcare that remains an opportunity for us. So things like tablets in that area, in home healthcare. So we're excited about that. Healthcare has always been a smaller piece of our business, but in one of the faster growing areas, and certainly that happened in Q2. I would say, if we move to EMEA, say overall strength in EMEA was relatively easy compare in Q2 compared to the other regions. Overall, the positive, I'd say in EMEA is that we saw some larger projects move ahead outside of retail. So this is one of the places where we've seen some growth in P&L outside of retail, and some competitive wins in EMEA. So we feel good about that. Manufacturing remains challenging in EMEA today. So I think that kind of mixed overall feel good about some P&L orders, large P&L orders, easier to compare where manufacturing makes challenging. So I think overall, I think we want to see North American EMEA, we'd expect to come out of this first, but we saw some strength in Latin America too. So I think mixed results across the region. Operator And the next question comes from Brad Hewitt with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Brad Hewitt -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey, good morning, guys. Wolfe Research, not sure what happened there. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Sorry, Brad. We missed the question. You broke up there during the question. Brad Hewitt -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Yes, sorry. So, just curious if you could elaborate a little more on what you're assuming in the second half from the top-line perspective. So at the mid-point of your full year guidance, it implies revenue in the second half, essentially flat with the Q2 run rate. So can you help me reconcile that versus kind of the early signs of momentum in mobile computing and also given the typical positive seasonality in Q4? Nathan Andrew Winters -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So if you look at our full year guide of four to seven with a mid-point of five and a half, I think from a year-on-year perspective, really driven by what we see is double-digit growth in the second half demand, it's about five points for the year where again, if you look at the full year, a lot of moving parts where the destocking from last year accounts for about five points of growth. But then we had the challenging comps in the first half that offset that. So again, really the full year growth is driven by underlying strength in the business in the second half. As we said, we see modest demand increases across each of our vertical markets. That's inclusive of the Q2 beat. So I think we look at it as really the strength we saw in Q2 continuing into the third quarter. I think similar to how we structured the guide over the last several quarters of not anticipating or expecting sequential improvement. But what have we seen here in the most recent weeks and months? We see that continuing here in July in terms of that stability in the business, albeit at a bit higher level than we saw as we entered the second quarter with modest increase as we go into the fourth quarter. So as Bill highlighted before, typically a lot of the year-end spend that we see from our customers has leaned toward large orders in the past, and again, being thoughtful about how we embed those in the guide until we have more certainty and commitments from our customers on moving forward with those projects before including it for our full year guide. So I think, we think it's grounded in what we see today, given that visibility into the large deployments and appropriate. Brad Hewitt -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. And then, you guys have talked in recent quarters about your expectation for seasonally lower opex spend in the second half of the year. Just curious if you could kind of shine some more light on that. And then, if we look at the implied Q4 EBITDA margins about 21%, can you talk about some of the puts and takes there on a sequential basis? Nathan Andrew Winters -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So if you look just historically, sometimes it is hard to see. But typically, as we go throughout the year, just based on when a lot of our trade shows, sales, kickoff meetings, timing of benefits, etc., tend to be more weighted toward the first half of the year. Then as you get into the back half of the year, you get into holiday seasons around the world, as well as some of the lower benefit costs as you go sequentially through the year. So I'd say a lot of the sequential improvement is timing-related now that we've kind of flushed through all of the restructuring benefits, or the vast majority of restructuring benefits through the P&L. And then, look at the sequential improvement in profitability from Q3 to Q4 is really based on that slight improvement in opex, as well as the higher volume leverage flowing to the bottom line. Operator And the next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Keith Housum -- Analyst Good morning, guys. Question for you on the software and services. With mobile computing being up double-digits, I guess, I would have expected a little bit of that flowing through more in software and services design as people sign up for their warranty contracts and things of that nature. Can you pass a little bit of light on the connection between the two and the modest growth that you had and that's in that line item this quarter? Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Keith, this is Bill. I would say that overall, we've seen consistent growth in software and services over the last several quarters. So we feel good about that. I'd say we continue to see strong attach rates with mobile devices. So the revenue lags that, of course, right? So ultimately, the strong attach rates continue with uptick in mobile computers. So no real change there. It's just not tied directly to revenue in the exact quarter depending on when the mobile devices are sold. So I wouldn't take anything away from that. We're continuing to see strong attach rates, really driven by things like upgrades around OS and security patches and so forth continue to be an important aspect of our customers buying service from us. I can say that we've seen in the past some customers extend their support agreements, and I think we're seeing a little bit less of that now, which is again a good sign for ultimately our customers looking to upgrade the mobile devices in the future. So maybe a little bit of less of that, if anything else. Overall, I'd say software and services, an important piece of our business, recurring revenue that we and others like. So I think all good there, nothing really to read into it, Keith. Keith Housum -- Analyst OK. I appreciate that. And then, just a follow-up, in terms of like, as most people are starting with here toward the refresh cycle of all the devices bought four or five years ago. How should we think about pricing today versus where it was, say, four years ago? Are people trading down to a lower mobile computer? Or as you think about most customers, is it relatively similar? But how do you think about pricing, what people are buying today versus four years ago? Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. I think we're -- obviously, there's customers are making choices on the type of device they need in their environment. So I think that we continue to see that. So if somebody needs a more rugged device, and their experience was they had a lower tier device and they beat those devices up, they'll move to a higher tier device and you'll see the reverse. If they had a good experience with a more rugged device, could they go to a more mid-tier type device? I think that happens all the time. I think we continue to focus on value that the devices bring to our customers to keep ASPs as high as we can, and then if we can't, to make sure that we're getting the same gross margin out of each tier of the portfolio. In the past, we've tiered the portfolio kind of good, better, best, or all the way down to kind of value tier. And I think that's allowed us to keep our pricing and margins higher. So if you want a higher spec device, you pay us a higher price for it. In the early days, call it, eight, nine years ago of -- eight years ago, nine years ago on Android, we didn't have as many flavors of devices. So you're discounting higher end devices to meet value to your players. We don't do that today. We're really tearing the portfolio has allowed us to kind of have conviction around our prices at the higher end, and we feel good about our customers and working closely with them to select the right device for the right use case. Operator And the next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Please go ahead. Brian Drab -- Analyst Hi. Thanks. You mentioned that you're seeing sequential improvement in all the end markets, including T&L and manufacturing. There have been some signs of further softness across the manufacturing industry in recent weeks, and I'm just wondering if you are seeing any of that show up in your customers buying patterns or if it really does feel like a pretty stable sequential improvement environment now. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. I'd say that, as we talked about before, I think in Q1 we saw kind of retail and e-commerce first, and now we've seen mobile computer -- mobile computing kind of grow across each of the vertical end markets. So retail, manufacturing, healthcare, I'd say that, we're still seeing challenges in manufacturing and overall, demand, especially in a large deal isn't back to the historical levels that it's been in the past. But in manufacturing specifically, we saw sequential improvement from Q1 and Q2. But I still think EMEA, for instance, we're clearly seeing a challenge in manufacturing where I would say overall, I wouldn't call manufacturing back to normalized levels in any way. But I think we just saw some sequential improvement, which I think was good. Manufacturing is an important segment for us. We see we've got lesser -- we're lesser penetrated in through manufacturing. Our relationship with manufacturing, many times are more in the warehouse or the finished production and moving that through the supply chain and some of our new solutions around machine vision, rugged tablets, our demand planning solutions for CPG manufacturers, all play into having a broader portfolio for manufacturing. So we ultimately see that a segment for growth for us, but I think still challenging the short-term. We would say, we're seeing probably about the same as you're seeing. Brian Drab -- Analyst OK. Thank you. And then, for follow-up, are you seeing opportunities potentially to gain share when we come out of this tougher environment? I mean, you obviously have a great balance sheet. You're not letting up in terms of investment in technology and customer service. Can you comment on how you might be potentially better positioned in both AIT and EVM ultimately? Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer I'd say that overall, we feel good about where we're at in our customer relationships. We continue to stay very close to our customers as we're a trusted partner to them. And I think that as the macro environment gets better, I think we would say that they will begin to buy again, especially, and we'll see large orders improve as we continue to solve growth in medium and run rate in second quarter. The installed base continues to grow. And I think that from that perspective, I think that we're seeing increased use cases across our customer environment. So some are still sweating their assets that will shift. They can't do that forever. So I think overall, we see the momentum in demand continuing and then continue to broaden both by vertical market to your first question, and then by size of order and order activity across small, medium and large type orders. Operator And the next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead. Rob Mason -- Analyst Yes. Good morning, Bill and Nathan. The strength in the gross margin, I think has already been commented on. But as you think about when large orders do come back, how should we be thinking or how are you thinking about sensitivity in the gross margin profile today versus, say, maybe 2018, 2019? Have you done anything different structurally around either your supply agreements or just as you mentioned, Bill, tiering the portfolio that would suggest the gross margin holds up better? Or does it have that kind of return to maybe 2018, 2019 levels when large orders come back? Nathan Andrew Winters -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Rob, I'd say just if you look, I would say, no structural difference in terms of maybe the differential between the margin we'd expect on a large yield versus kind of the run rate business. So that hasn't structurally changed. The one thing, if you go back, I think the one aspect, particularly if you go from 2019 -- since 2019, whether that's tariffs, the supply chain, challenges the rapid growth. So it's pretty challenging to find what's the right baseline. And if you go back to 2018, right, so I'm just the lower rev -- lower base. So I think, if you look at the business today, I think the strength across the portfolio is -- we have strength across the portfolio in terms of the underlying gross margin and being able to leverage the scale and leverage our distribution network as we've grown to inherently build a higher gross margin profile company. But again, I think it will be somewhat decremental as we in gross margin once large deals recover, but still incremental, as you think about it from a EBITDA rates. So I think there's the balance of -- there's still incremental margin to the total -- to the bottom line, but slightly dilutive in gross margin. Rob Mason -- Analyst I see. And just to go back on the regional discussions, my math, and maybe this is not totally right, but it did look like North America stepped down a little bit sequentially. If that is the case, just any color that you could provide on what you saw there. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, Rob, North America was down year-on-year. I'm not sure it's sequentially -- down sequentially as well. Nate's warning to me, I would say, overall mobile computing return to growth in North America, again, just like we saw across the other regions. So that clearly was positive. The other product categories were down, as a year ago, in first and second quarter, we saw supply chain challenges abate from a print and a scanning perspective. So the compares were pretty challenging for both those businesses. They had really good Q1 and Q2s of last year. So I think that impacted North America. In North America typically has an overweight on large deals as well. So growth in North America, we really like to see kind of run rate, mid-tier and large deals because the large deals are overweight typically in North America. So we saw kind of flat sequentially, as we said before, large deal activity, Q1 to Q2. And really, North America would like to see more large deal activity come back here in kind of second half, and then hopefully some year-end spend and then growth into 2025. So that's really the story of North America. Operator And the next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham. Please go ahead. Chris Grenga -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. This is Chris Grenga on for Jim. Most of my questions have been addressed, but maybe just one for me. The chart with the touchpoints is very helpful. Just wondering, as you look ahead to seeing larger projects return, are you preparing for large project activity to be in any one of these particular nodes, whether it's factory, warehouse store, or last mile, etc., or do large projects generally entail a broad coverage of one or many of those nodes, or just how you're thinking about that? Thank you. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. I think we see large deals typically across the portfolio, so that it's all about kind of size and scale of customers. So in retail, it'd be larger -- the larger retailers that would refresh and have refresh cycles or upgrades or larger orders across the portfolio that we do a multiple store upgrade, refreshing to a new device for instance. In transportation logistics, you'd see things like the fleet of last mile delivery drivers as an example. Upgrade across transportation logistics, or postal workers around the globe would be examples of large opportunities. So I think we see them across each one, they're a bit different. In manufacturing, it's more location by location or plant by plant, as opposed to large deal activities, would see in retail where they do multiple stores at once, or T&L, where they do an entire fleet of drivers or postal. So it's a bit different by nodes. So manufacturing more broken down by site, retail more, multiple stores at once, T&L more larger deployments, I would say, healthcare more, more like manufacturing, not as large a hospital systems more kind of hospital at a time or multiple hospitals at a time, but not those large refreshes. So I'd say large refreshes and upgrades more tied to retail and T&L. Operator And the next question comes from Guy Hardwick with Freedom Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Guy Hardwick -- Freedom Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Zebra issued some -- Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Guy Hardwick -- Freedom Capital Markets -- Analyst Good morning. Good morning, all. Zebra issued some very interesting press releases regarding working with Qualcomm to run LLMs on Zebra mobile computers, but without the requirements to kind of regular uploads to the cloud. So I was just wondering, Bill, just how close is Zebra to kind of a broad-based introduction of these kind of AI digital system products in mobile computing? Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. So we think of AI across the portfolio in several different ways. First is that just our core business really is about collecting real-time data, and that's used as kind of intelligence to feed AI models overall. So whether that's a barcode reading a printed label with the information on it back into the cloud, whether that's an RFID tag being read. So the idea of digitizing a customers' environment, getting real time data to AI models, and ultimately to generate insights in AI is a fundamental thing we do in our -- the value of our data that we collect feeds these models. So I think that's kind of the baseline of when we think about AI. Second is traditional, more traditional AI is used about probably in 50 different solutions across the portfolio today, whether that's optical character recognition or product recognition, navigation for autonomous mobile robots, package dimensioning inside our software around workforce planning and demand forecasting. So traditional AI is kind of the second piece that we think of across the portfolio. The third is what you're kind of referring to is the idea that it's AI assistant, right? Is that empowering the frontline worker through more information, leveraging a large language model on the device without connectivity to the cloud? Working closely with Qualcomm and Google, as you mentioned, to go do that. We've demonstrated that it -- at our National Retail Federation Trade Show in January. We demonstrated again at our innovation day. We also demonstrated at Google's Trade Show earlier this year as well. So I think we're excited about that opportunity. Today, it's not commercialized yet. We're continuing to work closely with our customers to really understand all the use cases, what's required around that. How do we best leverage which model in that case, how do we keep the model up to date? So a lot of different discussions with our customers about what that offering will look like. But we're excited to work with Google and Qualcomm on it. Our customers excited about having a digital assistant within retail or manufacturing. You think of all the use cases of making your newest worker as good as your most experienced worker, having all of your standard operating procedures at the hands of the associate or the frontline worker, being able to tie that back to what's the source of the data being restricted to the individual customer. So we think it's a driver long-term for our mobile devices and a differentiator for us. But today, still early days, more pilots and demonstrating and working with customers than commercialization. Guy Hardwick -- Freedom Capital Markets -- Analyst If you don't mind just me pushing a little bit on that. I mean, in terms of commercialization, is it a 2025 timeframe or beyond that? Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, no, likely -- like we're going to have more demonstrations around it that we're planning today with some of our customers at the National Retail show as we go the next step along with it next year in 2025, and then probably commercialization in likely in 2025 as I would see it today. Guy Hardwick -- Freedom Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Operator And the final question comes from Rob Jamieson with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Rob Jamieson -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst Hey. Good morning, Bill and Nathan. Congrats on the quarter. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Rob. Rob Jamieson -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst Just wanted to kind of ask more of a high-level question around and go back and revisit M&A and add an adjacencies. I mean, you all have a great installed base and a lot of market share across your various verticals. As we think about you adding adjacencies and what you've done recently, adding things like Fetch and Matrox and other markets, given the comfort that your customers have with you, do you think that as we return to like a more normal environment that will kind of, you can leverage that and your customers be more comfortable maybe deploying a new solution, something more kind of like advanced like Fetch or Matrox in their operations. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer I think that clearly are strategic relationships with our customer creates an opportunity for us to deploy a broader set of solutions within those customers. That that trusted partnership allows us to go do that. I think the backdrop of the environment hasn't been all that great. So machine vision is a good example of that. It's been kind of a challenging market and then our diversification just takes time where we were centered really around more semiconductor manufacturing and moving outside of that. So -- but that is -- our customers are giving us an opportunity to sell solutions in that space because we have a relationship with them already. I think we're seeing the same thing across retail software and robotics, as you mentioned. So clearly it matters. Our breadth and depth of our current portfolio, the relationship we have with them, the fact that we're a trusted partner to them; it's not always the same persona. So it's not -- I wouldn't say it's easy. Meaning we've got to get from our current buyer of our solutions and the person who deploys our solutions today to someone else within the organization. So if we're working with somebody inside a manufacturer more on the distribution of products at the end of the manufacturing line, we now need to form a relationship with somebody on the manufacturing line for things like machine vision solutions to stick with that example. So it's not easy, but it's certainly doable. And our -- because of our trusted relationship, they're willing to make that introduction. And then, we've got to earn our way in and prove our solutions into that manufacturing space. But we're given that opportunity because of those relationships. Rob Jamieson -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst That's helpful. And I appreciate it. And then, to the extent that you're willing to share, just as you talked about adjacencies and things you're looking at in the portfolio, is there anything either high level or specific that you're looking at the moment, just especially as your leverage is getting to an attractive point here. Thank you. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer No, I think that again, it's -- we think of assets that are closely adjacent to the portfolio overall, and really synergistic to what we do today. We'd like to do things in the similar vertical markets for the reasons we just talked about. So all that comes into play. And then, ultimately, as I said before, a little bit higher hurdles at the moment, given the macro uncertainty to make sure that if we were going to acquire something, or the certainty of revenue, and then ultimately higher risk interest rates weigh down on that a little bit. So I think overall, we continue to be inquisitive. It's got to be the right asset and the right fit for Zebra. Operator This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Burns for any closing remarks. Bill Burns -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. I'd like just to wrap up by saying thank you to our employees and partners for continued support of Zebra and execution in the second quarter. We're now positioned for growth in the second half year. So have a great day everyone. Thank you.

question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question come damian karas ubs. please go ahead. damian karas -- analyst hey, good morning, everyone. congrats quarter. bill burn -- chief executive officer good morning, damian. damian karas -- analyst bill, wanted get thought suspect going take bring larger project activity back fold, maybe could give u sense on, sound like expecting much year. much upside guidance think would fact start see return sooner rather later? bill burn -- chief executive officer yes, damian, think look back q1, saw early sign recovery, talked last quarter retail e-commerce. certainly encouraged better expected sale result q2, really, saw momentum, said around beyond retail really. really, driven mid-tier run rate business. large deal activity pretty consistent q2 coming q1, still well historic levels. think see customer overall continue cite uncertainty u market, markets, end markets, really reflecting purchasing behavior. say large deployment overall spread mid-size deal smaller deals, spread longer period time this, think ultimately, placing small orders, placing add installed base new application expansion opportunity to-date. think pipeline opportunity remains strong. think there's optimism part partner customers. think like see momentum large orders. saw first uptick large order first quarter kind flat second quarter. feel ok that. saw growth mid-tier run rate. think like see large order activity call broader base recovery. think seeing strength mobile computing, strength across kind large orders, medium small. want see large order really customers. think driven caution what's happening macro today. damian karas -- analyst great. make sense. want ask cost front, seems like there's pick back shipping rates, know little bit headwind guy past years. extent maybe experiencing cost inflation maybe talk what's kind guidance rest year? thanks. nathan andrew winter -- chief financial officer yes. damian, seen modest increase rate due whether that's red sea issue stronger demand, particularly ocean rates. say modest impact term incremental cost included full year guide. team's working several action term different air modes, leverage cost improve transit time, well working partner around forecast remainder year get ahead that, second half demand mitigate much possible. absolutely seeing increase, say pretty modest point within second half guide. operator next question come jamie cook truist securities. please go ahead. jamie cook -- analyst hi. good morning congratulation nice quarter. guess, first question, guess, struck quarter, evm margin much better thought, think even better expectations. think guiding margin sequentially. speak driver behind that? guess, that's first question. then, stop give second question after, guess. nathan andrew winter -- chief financial officer good morning, jamie. so, yes, look overall gross margin 48.6%, highest gross margin quarter three years, benefiting level large deals. strength run rate mid-tier positive gross margin particular within evm segment. also seeing continued strength service software margin again, heavily less weighted toward evm, well fully rolling premium supply chain costs. again, think part strength quarter really seeing incremental volume fall bottom line, driving sequential improvement gross margin within evm particularly. jamie cook -- analyst ok. then, guess, given strength margin quarter, mean, think ebitda margin guide now, 20% 21%, think 20%. wondering see better pull-through back half year, particular top-line growth would see relative decline flat revenue second quarter. nathan andrew winter -- chief financial officer yes. look ebitda guide third quarter 20% 21% year-on-year, that's primarily due volume leverage, nearly nine points. think expect similar deal, well business mix q2 q3 get similar margin profile q2 q3. look q3 guide, effectively flat q2 based assumption kind underlying mix deals, well business unit mix give u similar profile. say really expect level incremental benefit sequentially able realize incremental benefit q2 restructuring actions. then, see modest uptick implied guide fourth quarter incremental volume. operator next question come tommy moll stephens. please go ahead. tommy moll -- stephen inc. -- analyst good morning thank taking questions. bill burn -- chief executive officer good morning. nathan andrew winter -- chief financial officer good morning, tommy. tommy moll -- stephen inc. -- analyst first question large order activity. point nearly july, fully baked customer budget year? point large deal conversation really start become one centered around 2025, lot customer budget refreshed? bill burn -- chief executive officer think that, tommy, say customer continue scrutinize budget even well year, right? think with, past, seen kind year-end spending customers, think uncertainty around economy still kind weighing large deployment happen kind second half year here. think typically visibility quite yet whether there'll year-end spending customers. talking certainly pipeline opportunity see. then, question is, move ahead late 2024 2025. think macro perspective, whether interest rate presidential election manufacturing production, shipping parcel, parcels, shipment started inch turn positive volume growth volume. think kind weighing business, think there's even though got budgets, kind reluctance move ahead those, really macro factor overall. think expect continue kind stabilize. get confidence business abate get kind second half year 2025. say, overall, many discussion customer regarding projects; really taking longer kind move forward still. now, again, saw large order activity flat q1 q2 overall, saw pickup mid-tier run rates. positive signs. growth outside retail, really saw first quarter broader segment. mobile computing first decline first return growth expected that. think everything's moving right direction. think -- think customer know kind year-end 2024 2025, optimistic, would say, everything's moving right direction. tommy moll -- stephen inc. -- analyst bill, competitive standpoint, anything sensed changed particularly large deal context seen market participant perhaps become aggressive price whatever factor? bill burn -- chief executive officer yes. no, would say really competitive environment changed lot. overall, certainly continuing maintain share marketplace. feel good differentiation bring marketplace depth breadth solutions, competitive advantages, scale, technology, leadership, partner community, go-to-market, relationship customers. large deal, phenomenon coming, returned historic level really zebra. truly market. really see mark change competitive perspective. always going competitor there, large small, continues case. nothing there. feel good market position continue win market. operator next question come joe giordano td cowen. please go ahead. joseph giordano -- analyst hey, guys. good morning. bill burn -- chief executive officer good morning. nathan andrew winter -- chief financial officer good morning, joe. joseph giordano -- analyst bill, mentioned, guess, last quarter distributor asking product willing sell because, hesitant wanted make sure understood going try prevent future buildup inventory need get liquidated again. like, what's update that? kind started give requesting? nathan andrew winter -- chief financial officer yes, joe. nathan. take that. say overall, global channel inventory look day hand still normalized level. think pocket around world, there's still little bit rebalancing driving inventory channel, well there's incremental needs. think similar last quarter, working one partner across region ensure appropriate level inventory demand expecting see pipeline. again, remains collaborative. say similar position q1, there's always want little bit more. again, trying make sure right amount channel support end users, getting ahead ourselves, given uncertainty talked about. joseph giordano -- analyst fair enough. then, could ask smaller businesses, give u update trend within like rfid matrox fetch maybe see business term like growth size exiting year? bill burn -- chief executive officer yes. take that, joe. say, rfid challenging kind second quarter compare cycling large opportunity year ago. would say overall would expect return growth second half year. continue -- move second half really strong backlog pipeline opportunity across retail transportation, logistics, manufacturing. seeing continued use case across rfid, including moving beyond apparel general merchandise inside retail. clearly track trace across supply chain, parcel tracking within t&l, baggage tracking within airlines, lot opportunity across rfid. would say machine vision. continue excited opportunity within machine vision, challenging market moment. matrox acquisition, acquired asset, knew heavily weighted toward semiconductor equipment manufacturing, still challenge segment well. decline quarter machine vision, feel good overall. saw strength adaptive vision acquisition. software -- machine vision software quarter bright spot. say diversification business, focus along matrox business diversify area like automotive logistics new areas. also organic investment machine vision, really applies logistics area. diversification going well. ultimately, calling customers. seeing opportunities. continuing invest go-to-market across globe seeing opportunity across machine vision. feel good great opportunity zebra overall. say software -- software assets, seeing combination mobile devices, especially wearable space asset software pretty excited about. word cloud solution really focus retail leveraging mobile device hand retail associates. continue advance bring solution together combine thing like wearable mobile computing. seen early win there. feel good portfolio. smaller segment market, right, or, sorry, market, meaning smaller segment business overall piece business. really mobile computing returning growth, segment challenged. area see driving future growth zebra. operator next question come andrew buscaglia bnp. please go ahead. andrew buscaglia -- analyst hey. good morning, guys. bill burn -- chief executive officer good morning. nathan andrew winter -- chief financial officer good morning. andrew buscaglia -- analyst yes. want get thought potential upgrade devices, especially 2025. data share around age installed base? presumably lot device sold covid start see natural need upgrade next year, would think. bill burn -- chief executive officer say overall we're, mobile computing perspective, say customer really absorbing capacity built pandemic anything else. think there's clearly continued upgrade cycle across customers. idea built much capacity pandemic using capacity today, economy slowed, created even capacity, ever using capacity off, think seeing customer move idea absorbed capacity beginning buy again. that's kind early sign seeing. say there's solid pipeline opportunity mobile computing overall, kind refresh new use case

         "It's been a tough four years for Snowflake ( SNOW 0.38% ) . The cloud-based data warehousing company went public at $120 per share on Sept. 16, 2020, more than doubled on its first trade to $245, and touched a record high of $401.89 on Nov. 16, 2021. At the time, the bulls were impressed by its triple-digit percentage growth rates and investments in its IPO from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) . The buying frenzy in growth and meme stocks amplified its share price gains and caused many investors to overlook its soaring valuation. But as of this writing, Snowflake trades at about $127. It has nearly taken a round trip back to its IPO price as its growth cooled off and rising interest rates compressed its valuations. Snowflake's product revenue, which accounts for most of its top line, soared 106% in its fiscal 2022 (which ended in January 2022) and another 70% in fiscal 2023, but grew by just 38% in its fiscal 2024. Management expects that deceleration to continue with just 24% growth in fiscal 2025. Snowflake mainly attributed the slowdown to macroeconomic headwinds, but its persistent losses and the abrupt retirement of its CEO Frank Slootman earlier this year prevented the bulls from coming back. I recently argued that investors might be getting too bearish on Snowflake -- but three red flags could hold its stock back for the foreseeable future. 1. Berkshire Hathaway has given up Salesforce gradually sold all of its shares of Snowflake throughout 2021 and 2022, but during that period, Berkshire Hathaway held on to all 6.13 million of the shares it picked up in the IPO. That only accounted for about 0.2% of the conglomerate's massive investment portfolio, but the bulls believed that its faith in the company indicated that it was still a worthwhile long-term investment. After all, Buffett rarely invests in tech stocks -- and previously, he only invested in blue chip tech companies like Apple , HP , IBM , and Oracle . That's why Berkshire's investment in Snowflake, a hypergrowth cloud stock without any GAAP ( generally accepted accounting principles ) profits, attracted so much attention. But in the second quarter of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its entire stake in Snowflake. It still likely reaped a profit since Snowflake's stock traded at an average price of $147.69 during the quarter, but that would have been a disappointing result. That sale wasn't too surprising. Berkshire Hathaway has been selling a lot of stocks -- including half its stake in Apple and all of its HP shares -- to raise more cash over the past year. Buffett's conglomerate ended its latest quarter with a record $277 billion in cash and equivalents on its books -- so it might be keeping some powder dry for a potential market crash in the near future. However, this sale also eliminates one of the most compelling reasons to stick with Snowflake. 2. Ongoing security problems Back in May, Snowflake disclosed a \"potential compromise\" of its data warehouses. The following month, it admitted it was facing a \"targeted threat campaign against some Snowflake customer accounts\" and enlisted CrowdStrike and Alphabet 's Mandiant to investigate the attacks. Last month, AT&T (NYSE: T) disclosed that hackers had gained access to \"nearly all\" of its wireless subscribers' calls and text messages during a six-month period in 2022 through Snowflake's data warehouses. Other affected customers include Live Nation 's TicketMaster and LendingTree . It's likely that many other big customers were affected, since Snowflake was already serving 709 of the Global 2000 companies at the end of the first quarter of its fiscal 2025. 3. Competitors at the gates If that crisis deepens, Snowflake could struggle to attract new customers. Its other big competitors -- most notably Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Redshift, Microsoft Fabric, and Databricks -- could capitalize on that chaos and lure away some of its existing clients. In the note accompanying their recent downgrade of Snowflake's stock from overweight to equal weight, Wells Fargo analysts warned that it could lose more customers if it didn't resolve its security issues. They also said Snowflake's recent management changes -- including the ascension of new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy and the departure of Executive VP of Engineering Greg Czajkowski in July -- could exacerbate those problems. All of those challenges prompted the bank's analysts to reduce their price target on the stock from $200 to $130. Should retail investors take the contrarian view? Snowflake's stock has declined by 36% this year, but trading at a ratio of 12 times this year's sales, it doesn't look like a bargain. I gave it the benefit of the doubt as long as Berkshire Hathaway was still an investor, but the recent liquidation of that position suggests that its weaknesses could offset its strengths. Snowflake isn't headed off a cliff yet, but I think it's a bit too early to take the contrarian view.",

My name is Elliot, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second-quarter PPG earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] To allow everyone an opportunity to ask a question, the company requests that each analyst ask only one question. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alex Lopez, director of investor relations. Please go ahead, sir. Alex Lopez -- Director, Investor Relations Thank you, Elliot, and good morning, everyone. This is Alex Lopez, director of investor relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our second-quarter 2024 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Tim Knavish, chairman and chief executive officer; and Vince Morales, senior vice president and chief financial officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday, July 18th, 2024. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the investor center of our website, ppg.com. These slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Tim will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effects on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG's chairman and CEO, Tim Knavish. Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second-quarter 2024 earnings call. I'd like to start by providing a few highlights on our second-quarter 2024 financial performance and then I'll move to our outlook. The PPG team delivered sales of 4.8 billion and our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year segment margin improvement. This culminated in second-quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.50, which is an all-time record for the company and represents 11% year-over-year growth. Despite increasingly challenging macroeconomic conditions, we are building top-line momentum as our underlying year-over-year volume progression improved for the sixth consecutive quarter. In the second quarter, six of our 10 business units delivered positive volume growth versus prior year aided by our enterprise growth strategy initiatives. These initiatives included delivering new products and technologies to our customers, such as our innovative packaging interior can and exterior and coatings technologies, as well as our new SIGMAGLIDE technology in our marine business. Each of these technologies has allowed us to gain share in their respective businesses. Our actions also include upgrading and modernizing our manufacturing capabilities to drive increased output, such as in aerospace, where demand has outpaced industry supply. One additional example of our enterprise growth strategy is where we're driving changes to the ecosystem of the business models. This includes in architectural coatings U.S. and Canada with our Home Depot initiative and our refinish business with our digital tools such as MOONWALK and LINQ and in our traffic solutions business as we further optimize our service and supply capabilities, which are critical value drivers in this business. Additionally, our volume performance in the quarter benefited from our well-established business portfolio in Mexico, China, and India. Overall, however, our aggregate volumes in the quarter were flat year over year, falling shy of our initial expectations as overall demand in Europe and global auto OEM production were below what we assumed in our second-quarter guidance. It is important to note that our European volumes, while still negative, improved sequentially year over year versus the first quarter. Also, global industrial activity remained subdued in the quarter, consistent with our financial guidance in April, our second-quarter automotive refinish sales were down year over year, reflecting a strong prior-year comparison and lower insurance claims. However, we remain confident that this business will have a strong second half of 2024. In the quarter, we drove further margin enhancement, and we marked our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year segment margin improvement. Our aggregate gross margin was 43% for the quarter, a 180-basis-point improvement year over year. Our performance coatings segment achieved all-time record segment margin of 18.7%, and our industrial coatings segment also improved its margin profile by 120 basis points versus the prior year. During the second quarter, we benefited from stable upstream and downstream supply chains, and the vast majority of our suppliers have sufficient or excess capacity, which is noteworthy as this occurred during the peak season for raw material consumption. Consistent with our guidance, we experienced mid single-digit percentage raw material deflation that we expect will normalize into flat to low single-digit deflation for the third quarter as we anniversary prior-year impacts. This benefit was partially offset in our results by general inflation, including higher year-over-year wages and employee benefits. We are proud to have published our 2023 ESG report in the quarter, which highlighted progress against our 2030 targets, including increasing sales from sustainably advantaged products and reducing greenhouse gas emissions throughout our own operations and our value chain. I want to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on our previously announced strategic reviews of the architectural coatings U.S. and Canada business and the global silica products business. We made good progress with these processes and are pleased to have a number of engaged and interested parties. We're working through the traditional bidding, management presentation, and data provision stages and remain on our original schedule to determine a path forward for each of these assessments. We have also made further progress in driving improvement in working capital, including lowering our year-over-year inventories during the quarter. As a result, our operating working capital was down 90 basis points year over year. We have more work to do over the balance of the year as we move toward seasonally slower sales quarters, but we have already returned to near pre-pandemic inventory levels. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and remain committed to deploy excess cash for shareholder value creation. During the quarter, we repurchased $150 million of PPG shares, bringing our year-to-date total to about $300 million. This is on top of our fourth-quarter 2023 repurchases. Also yesterday, consistent with our long heritage, our board authorized a $0.03 dividend increase from $0.65 to $0.68 per share. Now, looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect overall organic sales of flat to low single-digit percentage growth. In Mexico, we expect to again deliver excellent financial results. We also believe that demand in China will deliver organic growth as a result of our technology-advantaged products but albeit at a lower growth rate than achieved in the first half of the year. In Europe, demand remains uneven by country and end use, but we expect modest sequential year-over-year improvement. In addition to those businesses that grew in the second quarter, we expect organic growth in automotive refinish coatings and protective and marine coatings, and also, while slightly unfavorable year over year, we are expecting product -- projecting modest sequential quarterly improvement in general industrial demand. We expect to deliver adjusted third-quarter EPS between $2.10 and $2.20 per share, aided by solid operating performance. Our guidance midpoint is 4% higher than our record third quarter 2023. However, the midpoint of our guidance is 10% higher than the third quarter of '23, excluding the impact of a higher year-over-year tax rate as the prior year included several non-recurring favorable discrete tax items. The difference in the tax rate is reducing our year-over-year EPS comparison by approximately $0.12 at the midpoint. We anticipate overall company selling prices to be flat in the third quarter as the impact of certain index based customer contracts in our industrial coatings segment will be offset by selling price increases in our performance coatings segment, including some additional incremental pricing that will be realized in the third quarter. With regard to commodity raw materials, supply remains ample, and we continue to realize benefits from moderating input costs. In the third quarter, we expect flat to low single-digit percentage raw material deflation, lower than the second quarter as we anniversary some decreased realized in 2023. As we have consistently demonstrated, we will further -- we will drive further improvement of our operating margins aided by sales volume growth leverage as a result of the execution of our enterprise growth strategy and self-help in manufacturing productivity and cost control initiatives, which includes continued execution of our previously approved restructuring actions. Our more than 50,000 employees are committed to delivering best-in-class solutions to our customers that will drive growth for PPG. Our results this quarter were made possible by our highly dedicated team around the world who make it happen and deliver on our purpose to protect and beautify the world every day. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, would you please open the line for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John McNulty -- Analyst Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So. I guess maybe the first one would just be on the -- the U.S. and Canada architectural review. It sounds like you're getting a reasonable amount of interest. Would you say that that's increasing the likelihood of a sale versus some of the other avenues, JVs, partnerships? I think you kind of said at the beginning of all this, any option is open, but -- but it sounded like a sale was the preference. Would you say there's a high likelihood of this ending up being a sale? Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hey, John. Thanks for the question. We're very pleased with the level of interest in the architectural U.S. and Canada business. And I will say that level of interest has great diversity across the scenarios that may end up being the final path forward. So, it is -- it's just too early at this point to say which one of those is kind of leading the pack as we've had really good interest in a number of different scenarios from full sale to JV and other forms of partnerships. So, just too early, John, but we are making good progress. Vincent J. Morales -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer And, John, this is Vince. As we said -- as Tim said in the opening remarks, we're in the normal process working with these interested parties, working with our bankers, having traditional management meetings, etc. So, we remain on our original schedule to determine a path forward. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer -- Analyst Yeah, good morning, guys. A question on auto OEM. So, the numbers you put up were worse than like if we're looking at just the global auto builds, you know, S&P or IHS. So, is that a customer footprint issue? Is it a destocking by the customer? First -- and then do we need to anniversary that? Are there two more quarters after this that are going to kind of be down high single digits to get to a new level of run rate? Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Duffy. Thanks for the question. You know our numbers, our projections may have been a bit different than what you're seeing from some of the kind of global services -- service providers. A couple of things there. We do have a very strong position in Europe, which -- which was down more more than average. And also our projections, while services maybe are looking more at macros, our projections for Q3 in particular are based on what we actually see in specific assembly plant schedules at the plants that we serve. And a number of them have increased, just very recently increased their summer downtimes. So, that may have a disproportionate impact versus what you may be seeing publicly. And then finally, I'd say, as you know, we have a very strong position in China, and we did see a step down in China production plans as soon as the EV tariffs were announced. And I think some of our customers are playing it cautious here until they see how that scenario plays out because, as you know, particularly the largest producer there is exporting quite a bit there. So, we do think that's a transitory item that will play out. Vincent J. Morales -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer And, Duffy, this is Vince. Just just a point of clarification. In our materials, we provide organic sales numbers which, for us, includes volume and price. As we've alluded to many times this year, in this business and in our industrial segment, we have index-based pricing. So, excluding price, we're much closer to the service provider numbers that you alluded to in your question. So, you have to bifurcate price versus volume. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi -- Analyst Yes. Good morning. Thank you. Tim, can you give us a bit more color on the volume trend line in Europe during the second quarter? You know, you mentioned it was a bit below your forecast. Which specific businesses perhaps were a little bit below​? I think you called out auto OEM. And then secondly, you know, in terms of the flattish volumes on a consolidated basis year over year for 2Q and the margin improvement which was quite significant, can you just give us some of the high-level drivers of that? Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure, Ghansham. Thank you for the questions. Yeah. The volume -- the volume trend in Q2 did play out a little worse than we expected, particularly at the end of the quarter. You know, June in particular was soft, largely driven by what I just said on Duffy's questions, as certain assembly plants started to add additional down weeks. And that affected U.S. and Europe. So, that was one thing that played out. The other one is the deco business in Europe, softer than we expected, again, particularly in the last months of the quarter. A little more color there, we're very strong in France, and that's one of our larger countries for sales. And as you know, that had some unique situations going on there. So, that did slow down for us in June. But interestingly, a subset of the Europe story is Eastern Europe has been stronger than expected, where we actually also have a very strong position in countries like -- sorry, Poland and others. So, it was really those two businesses in Europe that trended downward as the quarter -- quarter progressed. And then the overall volume being flat versus what we had previously said was really driven globally by auto and locally in Europe by architectural. Those were the two big ones. But you know, as I said in my opening remarks, we did -- we have been improving sequentially over the last six quarters. If you go back to end of '22, we were down negative 5% in volume, and that has steadily improved to where we we're printing flat this quarter. And also in my remarks, I said there were six out of 10 businesses that were positive volume for us. Just to give you some context there, last year, that was three out of 10. So, we went from three out of 10 to six out of 10, and we're planning on eight out of 10 in Q3 being positive. So, a little under where we wanted to be for Q2, largely driven by end of quarter in those two businesses. But we feel good about the momentum, Ghansham. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chris Parkinson -- Analyst Great. Good morning, everybody. You know, I don't think any of us are really going to doubt that the macro has been a little bit choppier than most were anticipating into the second quarter. But you know, Tim, you've been really focusing on the portfolio and your ability to outgrow certain end markets. I know it's still a bit early and perhaps tough to tell, but what would be -- what would be at this juncture, the two to three end markets where you are, by far and away, the most comfortable in PPG's ability to consistently outperform market growth rates? Thank you. Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Hey, Chris. Thanks for the question. You know, number one, aerospace. You know, we're really just -- as I've said for the last several quarters, everything we can make is -- is sold and shipped. We're adding capacity. We're improving productivity. We've improved output in this past quarter. So, we're selling more, and we'll continue to outperform. You know, despite the -- I always say that with refinish, you really have to look over a full-year basis with this business because you always have order pattern issues from the distributors around the world. Refinish, we continue to gain share and refinish by execution of our digital systems which have been, you know, widely accepted and embraced. And we keep adding to that toolbox of new digital tools, Chris. So, I feel really good about that business. Packaging, outperforming from a volume standpoint, and we still haven't launched everything that we've won in the last few quarters. Traffic, although not our biggest business, you know, that's -- I want to point to a business that, the first couple of years, I would say we cleaned up that business. And now, we're in a position where it is really starting to perform for us. Other businesses, very, very much by specific region, but those would be the four that, overall, I would say, were outperforming. But I do want to point out three other things. Aggregate Mexico, just Mexico across the board, whether it's PPG Comex or our industrial segment businesses or protective and coatings, protective marine, we're outperforming Mexico. Aggregate China, of course with excluding deco where we don't play, aggregate China, we're outperforming. Aggregate India, except for Deco where we don't play, we're outperforming. So, that's how I would describe the businesses that I feel most confident about our over performance going forward, Chris. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David Begleiter -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning. Tim, as you go through the review of your U.S. paint business, will you see any disruptions to the business? In particular, are you seeing any market share losses as -- due to challenges or disruptions in the business? Thank you. Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Dave. We had a very good quarter in that business. So, of course, that was something that -- you know, we had some concerns about as we announced it. But internally, the team has done a really good job working with our employees, our customers, our distribution partners in the private dealer space, our big box customers. And we had a -- we had a good quarter in that business, mid single-digit growth. So, while we -- and it's something we're watching and monitoring very closely and trying to stay ahead of it. I'd say the team did a really good job in Q2 of doing that, and we're expecting the same in Q3. There's lots of discussions. Of course, there's some anxieties, but so far, that has not had any kind of sizable impact on the financial results. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John Roberts -- Analyst Thank you, Tim. Are you still on track with the silica sale as well, and how do you feel about the rest of the specialty materials portfolio? Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, John. Thanks for the question. Silicas, we're very much on track with that, maybe even a little ahead of where we are on architectural U.S. and Canada. We've had good interest there as well, and let's just say we're on our original schedule. The rest of that specialty business we really like. And here's why. Because we have a leadership position in those spaces, and they're high technology spaces, which is right in our wheelhouse from a R&D capability standpoint. So, not the -- obviously, not the biggest part of our portfolio, but that business was one of the good growth engines for us in Q2. We expect that to continue going forward. So, they're good businesses for us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne -- Analyst Yes, thank you. And, Tim, if you had a clean slate of how to report your financials, you have these 10 businesses, you have some looming divestitures. If you were to report that network of businesses, would you choose two segments, and would you allocate them the way they're currently arranged? Or would you consider going down a path of either more segments or reporting revenue by business, something to drive more transparency? Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Steve. You know, it is something I've been giving a lot of thought to, and we'll continue to think about it and see what things look like post-architectural USCA. But high level, we have a group of businesses that essentially deliver factory to factory, pure B2B type of businesses where they go from our factory to an assembly plant or our factory directly to a paint shop of some kind. And that's a logical fit because they have a lot of synergies, synergies in operations, synergies in raw materials, synergies in supply chain and logistics, and synergies in science and technology. We have another group of businesses that largely goes through distribution and has a lot of value-add services, you know, that are a key part of the value proposition like aerospace, like refinish, and like protective. So, high level, I'm comfortable with it, but it's something we do look at on a regular basis. And we'll take a fresh look once this transaction is done. But it -- you know, I'm pretty comfortable with how we report today. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews -- Analyst Thank you, and good morning. In our model, if we look out into 2025, we start to see raw materials move up probably low single digits in the first half of next year. So, is that something you'll look to get ahead of from a pricing perspective in the back half of the year, or will you take more of a wait-and-see approach? And are there any parts of the business where, you know, if we forget about refinish and aero or you have well-defined pricing power, are there any parts of the business, maybe auto OEM where you're a little more concerned about being able to pass that through? Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Hey, Vincent. So, what I would say at a very high level is there's sufficient capacity out there across the supply chain. Because if you look at the total industry of coatings, we're producing less liters than we did pre-COVID. And so, there's -- high level, there's still quite a bit of capacity out there. Of course, we do what we can to get ahead of it. And you pointed to some places where we can get ahead of it. The other businesses, largely the industrial segment, it's typically more real time. And in some cases, as you know, businesses are able to get pricing faster than others. And as we discussed during the last inflationary cycle, auto OEM is typically the slowest, but we eventually get there just like we did last cycle. So, I would expect that to play out the same in any cycle that may be on the horizon, whether it's next year or the following year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mike Sison -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the profitability at U.S. architectural paints? Has there been any improvement over the last year? Maybe what type of growth you think that business will generate in the second half? And then finally, Tim, when you think about the full sale, JV, or partnership, how are you thinking -- how are you thinking which one would be the best transaction for shareholders? Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, we -- you know, it's -- the best transaction for shareholders will come down to two pieces. One is what's the -- what are the proceeds, what do we get paid for what we're selling? And two, what's the long-term strategic value of anything we might be left with? So, that's why it's really hard for me or any of us to say here's the best shareholder value proposal right now because the combination of those two, price, proceeds, and future value of anything we might be left with, we're just not there yet in the process. But that's how we're thinking about. It is a combination of shareholder value today, for what we get, and shareholder value for future, for how it fits with our growth strategy and what we can expect from an earnings and cash flow on the long term. Vincent J. Morales -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And, Mike, on current events, look, as Tim just said in an earlier question, business is performing well. Volume are a key driver to profitability. You know, our volumes were up in Q2 as we said in the prepared remarks, so we're pleased with the progress year to date. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch -- Analyst Good morning, and congrats, Alex, on your new role. Tim, I want to -- I want to ask about the expectations for the second half to be lower than you previously thought, which resulted in the full-year EPS guide down. I'm just curious, you know, roughly, what was the -- when you think back three months ago or even six months ago when you first put out the full-year projection, what sort of level of volume growth were you expecting in the second half of the year? And where -- where are you now in terms of expectations on volume growth for the second half of the year? And I know that part of the reduction is tied to auto OEM. And you said that you've been surprised by the extension of the assembly plant downtime. Just curious, looking back in PPG's history, when you've been surprised in the past by the auto OEMs taking extended assembly plant downtime, does that serve as any sort of a foreshadowing of recessionary environments or anything like that? Any color there would be very helpful. Thank you. Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Hey, Frank. So, first of all, what changed from what we were saying about the full year to what we're saying today. It's largely a couple of big businesses like auto global and architectural Europe and, of course, the other businesses are puts and takes, some up, some down. So, that's really the biggest, the biggest driver. And to your second question, I'm not using the recession word at all. What I see more is temporary adjustments at assembly plants just given vehicles -- some certain vehicles selling less than expected and inventories going up a little bit. Inventories are still very healthy compared to pre-COVID levels, but if you look at U.S. inventories, they -- they did creep up a little bit. So, I think there's just some adjustment. There's caution from our customers on affordability, interest rates, things that really drive some of the vehicle purchase behavior by consumers. You know, you probably have your own prediction on interest rates. I have mine, but at some point, that should be a pressure that comes off of new car purchases. And I think our customers are just watching the same things very closely, inventories versus affordability and interest rates. But I -- I do not see this as foreshadowing of a recession of any kind. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Patrick Cunningham -- Citi -- Analyst Hi, good morning. I'm just curious on your optimism for the refinish outlook for the second half. You know, which regions do you expect to see the most meaningful growth? And how much of a role will MOONWALK and LINQ play for organic growth? And are you seeing anything in terms of data points or anything, order books, that gives you confidence in the underlying market growth in the back half? Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Patrick. So, I'd say the biggest confidence point for us is really everywhere outside of Europe where we're really still in the very early innings of launching our productivity digital ecosystem. We started that in Europe, gained tremendous share and customer retention and subscription revenue as we launched that across Europe. And we're still very early days in the U.S., Australia, China, places like that. So, good confidence in the share gain as we roll out those tools around the world. The collision rates are a question mark, depending on where you are around the world, but we believe our penetration rates of these digital ecosystem is still single digits of all the body shops out there. So, we've still got a lot of runway. And as I said in my -- in an earlier answer, we continue to add to that toolbox of digital productivity tools as we go forward. So, it is, of course, the chemistry inside the can, which we're best-in-class at from a color match and speed and all those things. So, we feel really good about that, but a lot of our share gain right now is delivered by the productivity tools outside the can. Vincent J. Morales -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer And just to get to your question on the second half of the year, just a little bit of history. Again, in 2023, we had a price increase going into effect in early Q3. We had a lot of our partners buy ahead of that price increase. So, as we alluded to in the prepared remarks, we had very strong Q2 and we finished last year a softer Q3, given the buy ahead. And that pattern reverses this year. So, that order pattern from our distributors is helpful for us in the back half of the year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Zekauskas -- Analyst Thanks very much. A two-part question. You've probably bought all your titanium dioxide through the end of the year, so I understand that there's no TiO2 pressure this year for you. But with Chinese -- with sanctions on Chinese product in Europe, is that a structural issue? That is, over the next four years, are you going to be facing as a base case reasonably higher TiO2 prices or much higher TiO2 prices? How do you think about that? And then secondly, in the quarter, your volumes and auto OEM in the U.S. contracted, and I think the production grew in the United States in the second quarter. Is that a temporary phenomenon for you, or are you losing share in the U.S.? Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. Hey, Jeff. On the TiO2, you are correct. We foresee no impact in 2024, not so much because of we're sitting on a whole bunch of inventory there but more because of we're contractual coverage. As we look to 2025, here's how we are thinking about it. First of all, at a very high level, we continue to reduce TiO2 consumption per batch without sacrificing performance. That's about 1% per year. And even though that doesn't sound like a big number, we've been doing it for a decade and we expect that to continue. Second thing, specific to the tariffs and anti-dumping, we have great flexibility around the world given the formulation work that our S&T teams have done such that we've really increased our sourcing flexibility versus where we were, say, five years ago. And then finally, at the end of the day, if those two initiatives are not enough to counter whatever net increase in costs there may be to us, we -- the biggest consumer of TiO2 is the deco business by far. And we have demonstrated that, as necessary, we'll offset that cost with price. Vincent J. Morales -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Jeff, let me just add on here to the TiO2 question before Tim goes to the next question. Two things. One, we're not either advantaged or disadvantaged versus others in the region as it relates to this issue. So, it's going to be a item for all coatings users. Secondarily, not all of our production and not all of our TiO2 consumption is in the E.U. We have plants outside of the E.U. that are not affected by the tariffs. So, we still have some capability to produce with unimpacted tariff Chinese TiO2. Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And, Jeff, to your second question on automotive, U.S. specifically, first of all, the final numbers that just really came in the last couple of days, the production in the U.S. was actually down, down low single digits in the quarter. And our sales were down mid single digits. And so, some of that would be -- Vince talked earlier, the production number that S&P puts out is volume, and our sales number is volume plus price. And we did have some contractual index price in that business. And then the rest of it would be specific assembly plants, specific customer mix that might vary from the -- kind of the industry average. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with VRP. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy -- Analyst Yes. Good morning, everyone. Tim, if I look at your second-quarter organic sales results versus your forecast from last quarter, it seems to me that PPG did a very good job of forecasting. And maybe eight of the 10 verticals where you compete, the two that I see that came in a little bit lower are architectural EMEA and protective and marine coatings. And so, I was wondering if you could speak to each of those businesses and maybe educate us a little bit as to why they came in a little bit weaker than you would have thought. And whether that was because of, you know, sort of transitory or idiosyncratic reasons? Or do you think they're on a different growth glide path, say looking into 2025? And any additional color on geographies or product lines would be super helpful. Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, sure. Hey, Kevin. Let me -- let me do architectural EMEA. Yeah, we were -- clearly, the results were lower than what we expected for the region in aggregate. We had -- we believed that we were -- you've probably heard me use the term bouncing off the bottom. We believe that at that time, we were on the bottom, and we would see sequential improvement Q1 to Q2. The macros frankly just got worse in Europe. And that drove deco, that drove auto OEM as well. But a little more color there, we are -- we're No. 1 in the 10 or so countries in Europe. And our biggest is France. I did earlier reference, you've seen, you know, the election and some of the turmoil in France that added to uncertainty. And we really did see a downturn in our sales during that period in France, our largest country. So, I would say that was -- that one was maybe a transitory, that as things stabilize, we'll see some recovery there. We're also No. 1 in most of the Nordic countries, which was also slower than the rest of the region. So, a little bit of country mix there on the offset. We're No. 1 in Poland and a number of the Central European countries that have started to recover. So, as we think about that going forward, we do believe we will see some sequential improvement in architectural Europe in Q3. We do believe it will still be down versus prior, Kevin, but we do think that that will start to sequentially improve. A much better story on protective and marine. As you know, that business has really been a good performer for us over the last several quarters. We just -- this is a project business. We just ran into a handful of project delay-type transitory items that hit us in the quarter. You should expect growth back on track in that business starting in Q3. You know, for example, we had slower China infrastructure spending than we expected with the local government issues. With the Mexican election, Pemex was delaying some of its projects. As you know, the election is behind us now, and we're seeing that pick up. We have been doing really well at gaining share in the dry dock business. We had some dry dock delays associated with going around the Cape. So, just a number of things like that that we do believe are transitory. But the underlying trends for that business for us are much stronger than what I would have described for the macro conditions for deco Europe. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Josh Spector -- UBS -- Analyst Yeah. Hi, good morning. I have two questions on the cost side. I guess first, European peer announced some contract renegotiations with its labor force that they talked about as an incremental inflationary. Is that an impact at all for PPG in the second half of 2025? And then on the other end, your corporate costs have come in better than you've guided in the last couple of quarters. With the reduction in guidance, are you accruing less for bonuses for this year? And is that a tailwind that's baked in this year and a headwind next year? If you could help quantify any of that, it would be appreciated. Thank you. Vincent J. Morales -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Josh. This is Vince. With respect to the E.U., that's -- you know, we're not involved in whatever that peers involved with. We're under our normal process in terms of reviewing our salaries, benefits on an annual basis. We did, as we alluded to at the beginning of the year, have a little bit of a higher wage and benefit inflation this year versus historical, given the macro. But again, we expect that to trend to normal based on what we know today and future years. As it relates to corporate costs, as we said in our press release, we did -- due to the lower guidance for the full year, we have made adjustments lower for some of our incentive compensation. And that will -- these are not big, big numbers. We'll give a full-year '25 guide as we typically would do in January. We got to get through the rest of this year before we look at year-over-year impacts, especially line by line or category by category. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyCorp. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about architectural EMEA pricing. Given these weaker volumes, is pricing holding up in this region, or is competitive environment perhaps more aggressive than for your coatings portfolio overall? Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Hey, Aleksey. Given the volume challenges, we have seen what I would call kind of around the edges some price downward competitive actions that we've -- we've had to match in order to keep our business that is an outlier versus most of our coatings portfolio. But I would also tell you that it's not -- it's not a huge impact because there's still higher -- even though folks are trying to grab volume and the raw material deflation is just not what it was earlier in the year, us and everyone are experiencing higher wage inflation, higher employee benefit inflation than, let's say, maybe a normal year. And we're not the only ones having to deal that so -- deal with that. So, I think that is having some impact whether you're talking about architectural EMEA where maybe it is slowing down any otherwise volume grab kind of behavior. But across the portfolio, that's enabling, frankly, price to hold up, and that's also enabling things like other parts of our portfolio in performance coatings to get additional price because us and everyone else are seeing that higher wage inflation. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mike Leithead -- Barclays -- Analyst Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. With the strategic reviews on track for this quarter, presumably, you'll get some level of cash in the door later this year. So, is it fair to -- for us to assume share repurchases are currently your preferred use of excess cash at the moment, or how does the acquisition pipeline look today? Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Mike. Great shareholder value accretive acquisitions would always be our preferred use of cash, whether it's from proceeds from these potential transactions or just ongoing business. That said, that pipeline is a bit thin right now. And so, we continue to look at opportunities, but overall, compared to prior years, I would assess it as thin. And perhaps, that'll change going forward. Perhaps, that'll change in 2025, you know, with interest rates. But right now, it's a bit thin. You've seen, three quarters in a row, we've bought shares back. We're demonstrating that we're going to do what we said, which is we're not going to let excess cash build on the balance sheet. So, when those transactions or potential transactions close, we will take -- look at our pipeline. And if it's still thin, then we'll deploy cash as we have in the last three quarters. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mike Harrison -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Was wondering, Tim, if you can give us a little bit more color on what's going on in the aerospace business. You mentioned that you -- you're selling everything you can make, but how much better could volumes have looked in that business if you didn't have the capacity constraints? And I guess, what specific actions or how much additional capacity do you think you can unlock as we get into the second half and into 2025? Thanks. Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Mike. Just to put some scale on it. Our backlog -- so, we produced more, sold more, had record quarter in that business, and yet our backlog still grew. So, our backlog is almost $300 million. So, whatever you have us down for as margin in that business, if we were completely unconstrained, it would be that 300 million at our aerospace margins. But going forward from that, there is nothing on the horizon that our customers are telling us that's going to slow that in the near future or midterm, at least. In fact, we're getting forecasts from them that are even higher. So, what we're doing in the short term is, I would call them incremental capacity additions, things you can do quickly, whether it's through productivity improvement or capex investments, both of which we're doing. But beyond that, we're assessing, do we need to do something of a larger scale? And when we're ready to talk about that, we'll let you know. But it's pretty significant backlog driven across commercial, general aviation, and military; driven across transparencies, coatings, and sealants; and driven across OEM and aftermarket. Every one of those is getting pulled from our advanced technologies. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with -- sorry, BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Laurent Favre -- Analyst Yes, good morning, all and team. Apologies, if France made you -- events in France made you miss your forecast. But I've got a question on industrial coatings pricing. On the minus 3%, can you unpack how much of that was indexation versus the rest? And are you seeing pressure away from indexation given weak volumes? And the second part of that question is, should we assume that the indexation part is going to get worse into H2, or are we at the trough in terms of the year-on-year impact? Thank you. Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Laurent. I'm expecting lots of paint sales as the Olympics get going here, and then after the Olympics as well. So, I'm sure France recovery is on the horizon. The pricing in the industrial segment, virtually all of it is index pricing. I don't want to say 100% because there's always things happening around the edges. But virtually all of it is index pricing. And I don't expect that to change significantly as we look through the rest of this year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Estok with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Dan Rizzo -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi, this is Dan Rizzo from Jefferies. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for fitting me in. I was just wondering, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about softness in exports from Chinese auto EVs kind of slowing. I was wondering if there, as of yet, anticipating a change in the environment if Trump were to take office. Like what's the lead time between they anticipate higher tariffs and potentially lower sales and that they end and shut down or slow down production? Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start. And all Trump questions I delegate to Vince. So, I'm going to let Vince handle that part. But what I want to say about the EVs is, we're a proud supplier to the No. 1 manufacturer over there. And of course, they were doing quite a bit of export. And so, they're being cautious right now, and we'll see how that plays out as far as their overall production numbers as we move through the year. But I do want to point out, even though -- even with all the headlines on EVs happening right now or maybe in a less-than-positive direction, I think that's only changing the slope of the curve and not the end point destination of the curve. For 2024, even with all the news we've heard, the projection is still that EV production will grow by 14% versus last year. And the production is still that 30% of every vehicle produced in China will be an EV. And of course, China produces about a third of all the world's cars. So, I think we all have to take these headlines as moderation but not drastically story-changing headlines for EV. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask a couple of more questions on North American architectural and the portfolio as well. So, on architectural, I think our understanding is 4% EBITDA margins for the whole group. But maybe the stores business was recently unprofitable. I don't know if that's something you can just shed some light on. And are you seeing any interest in the stores side of that as well, presumably we've heard that there's good interest on the non-stores business. But if there isn't on the stores, would you consider kind of keeping those or shutting those down? Or how do you proceed there? And then on the portfolio itself, as you look into '25, presumably, you won't have architectural in North America, so you will be a little bit more industrial levered. Is there any way you can kind of give us your thoughts on how we should think about that? Industrial businesses and coatings sometimes have fetched lower valuations. So, I don't know if that enters into your thinking as well. Thanks a lot. Vincent J. Morales -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Hey, Arun. Let me answer the North American architectural questions. Again, I think when we announced the strategic review in February, we gave some directional information, and certainly the people who are interested and engaged got the data, books, etc. And we're providing data almost on a daily basis, and we're not going to get into the nuances of the different channels. Again, we're in a process where there's a lot of folks looking at it. They have what they need. And we're not going to certainly get into how this may or may not be split. Again, there's a multitude of different scenarios that we're entertaining, and we'll let that process play out over the next 60 or 75 days or whatever. So, again, we'll let that process play out. And when we get to a ultimate conclusion, I think we'll be a little more granular to answer some of your questions. Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And let me take -- Arun, let me take the portfolio question. Mathematically, of course, you're spot on that ex this business, we will be a little heavier in industrial coatings and a little lighter in performance coatings. But you've seen the numbers and the guidance we've given on the profitability and margin of the architectural U.S. business. And ex that business, mathematically and going forward, despite that shift from -- that you described from less performance and more industrial, in aggregate, we will be a higher-margin and higher-growth company. And we wouldn't be doing this otherwise. And just to be clear, that there's also the benefit of us as a management team, as a PPG team being able to focus all resources, whether it's human resources, R&D resources, capital resources, bandwidth resources on businesses that have higher growth and higher margin profiles. So, we are fully confident that this is the right thing to do for not only customers, employees, but absolutely for shareholders going forward, fully confident. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jaideep Pandya with On Field Investment Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jaideep Pandya -- On Field Investment Research -- Analyst Thank you. First question is on packaging. Could you just tell us how confident are you to keep the share that you have gained because one of your competitors had a fire because we are hearing sort of opposite messages, and they seem to be confident they'll get the share back. So, just wondering how will packaging look in 2025? My second question is, sorry to come back to architectural North America, but looking back 10 years ago when you bought the actual business, it doesn't feel like a lot has changed in terms of either the store footprint or the plant footprint or even, for that matter, the profitability. And you alluded to one point, which was need for investment. So, just curious, when you look at JV models, where do you need to invest? And how do you sort of unpack and improve profitability here because you yourself done it with Akzo in the last 10 years, and sorry to say this, but it sort of hasn't worked. So, what would you and a JV partner do here? Just curious. And sorry to squeeze in one more. Tim, volume growth has been an issue for PPG for the last 11 quarters. How do you incentivize your sales force to go for volume if you, at all, want to do that? Thanks a lot. Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK, Jaideep. Thanks for the questions there. On packaging, high degree of confidence that we will keep our share gains and continue to grow this year. You did mention an incident one of our competitors unfortunately had, and of course, there was some things that the industry did to get through that. But we've won a lot of shares that had nothing to do with that incident. And so, we are confident going forward that our technologies inside the can, outside the can, on the easy-open end, our food lines, we're gaining share across a number of different spaces that had nothing to do with that isolated incidence. So, you know, good news ahead for that business. JV scenario for architectural U.S. and Canada, at the end of the day, there are -- I've said from the beginning that we believe this business could be more successful with a partner. And that partner could either buy the whole thing or do a JV. What that partner might be able to run more velocity through the high fixed cost that company-owned stores bring, they might be able to bring more velocity through whether it's other paint products or other building products in general. So, that is the big issue where a JV may be able to help us from that velocity through your high fixed cost stores. In volume growth, I mentioned as we move through 2023, in the first half of 2024, that we were modifying incentive comp to drive more organic growth. We've done some of that, some of that's already in place, and some of it is still being implemented as we speak. And that is one element of a multifaceted recipe that we're changing to drive a higher organic profile company. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aron Ceccarelli with Berenberg. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Aron Ceccarelli -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst Hello. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a very quick one on industrial coating. Would be interested in understanding if you can provide some color around the monthly run rate of volumes. And I would be particularly interested in the exit rate in June, if there's any area of the business that actually accelerated or decelerated at the end of the quarter. Thank you. Timothy M. Knavish -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yep. Aron, thanks for the question. So, at the end of the quarter, I would say industrial segment automotive was decelerating. As I previously mentioned, we got some further shutdown news as we move through the month of June. I would say industrial starting to -- you know, pretty flat. But we are starting to see some sequential improvement that we projected into Q3. And I think packaging, based in the last question, is accelerating from a volume standpoint. So, that's how I'd quantify the exit rates for industrial segment. Operator There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Alex Lopez.

think kind said beginning this, option open, -- sounded like sale preference. would say there's high likelihood ending sale? timothy m. knavish -- chairman chief executive officer hey, john. thanks question. pleased level interest architectural u.s. canada business. say level interest great diversity across scenario may end final path forward. so, -- early point say one kind leading pack really good interest number different scenario full sale jv form partnerships. so, early, john, making good progress. vincent j. morale -- senior vice president, chief financial officer and, john, vince. said -- tim said opening remarks, normal process working interested parties, working bankers, traditional management meetings, etc. so, remain original schedule determine path forward. operator next question come line duffy fischer goldman sachs. line open. please go ahead. duffy fischer -- analyst yeah, good morning, guys. question auto oem. so, number put worse like looking global auto builds, know, s&p ihs. so, customer footprint issue? destocking customer? first -- need anniversary that? two quarter going kind high single digit get new level run rate? timothy m. knavish -- chairman chief executive officer hey, duffy. thanks question. know numbers, projection may bit different seeing kind global service -- service providers. couple thing there. strong position europe, -- average. also projections, service maybe looking macros, projection q3 particular based actually see specific assembly plant schedule plant serve. number increased, recently increased summer downtimes. so, may disproportionate impact versus may seeing publicly. finally, say, know, strong position china, see step china production plan soon ev tariff announced. think customer playing cautious see scenario play because, know, particularly largest producer exporting quite bit there. so, think that's transitory item play out. vincent j. morale -- senior vice president, chief financial officer and, duffy, vince. point clarification. materials, provide organic sale number which, us, includes volume price. alluded many time year, business industrial segment, index-based pricing. so, excluding price, much closer service provider number alluded question. so, bifurcate price versus volume. operator next question come line ghansham panjabi baird. line open. please go ahead. ghansham panjabi -- analyst yes. good morning. thank you. tim, give u bit color volume trend line europe second quarter? know, mentioned bit forecast. specific business perhaps little bit below​? think called auto oem. secondly, know, term flattish volume consolidated basis year year 2q margin improvement quite significant, give u high-level driver that? timothy m. knavish -- chairman chief executive officer sure, ghansham. thank questions. yeah. volume -- volume trend q2 play little worse expected, particularly end quarter. know, june particular soft, largely driven said duffy's questions, certain assembly plant started add additional weeks. affected u.s. europe. so, one thing played out. one deco business europe, softer expected, again, particularly last month quarter. little color there, strong france, that's one larger country sales. know, unique situation going there. so, slow u june. interestingly, subset europe story eastern europe stronger expected, actually also strong position country like -- sorry, poland others. so, really two business europe trended downward quarter -- quarter progressed. overall volume flat versus previously said really driven globally auto locally europe architectural. two big ones. know, said opening remarks, -- improving sequentially last six quarters. go back end '22, negative 5% volume, steadily improved printing flat quarter. also remarks, said six 10 business positive volume us. give context there, last year, three 10. so, went three 10 six 10, planning eight 10 q3 positive. so, little wanted q2, largely driven end quarter two businesses. feel good momentum, ghansham. operator next question come line chris parkinson wolfe research. line open. please go ahead. chris parkinson -- analyst great. good morning, everybody. know, think u really going doubt macro little bit choppier anticipating second quarter. know, tim, really focusing portfolio ability outgrow certain end markets. know still bit early perhaps tough tell, would -- would juncture, two three end market are, far away, comfortable ppg's ability consistently outperform market growth rates? thank you. timothy m. knavish -- chairman chief executive officer yeah. hey, chris. thanks question. know, number one, aerospace. know, really -- said last several quarters, everything make -- sold shipped. adding capacity. improving productivity. improved output past quarter. so, selling more, continue outperform. know, despite -- always say refinish, really look full-year basis business always order pattern issue distributor around world. refinish, continue gain share refinish execution digital system been, know, widely accepted embraced. keep adding toolbox new digital tools, chris. so, feel really good business. packaging, outperforming volume standpoint, still launched everything last quarters. traffic, although biggest business, know, that's -- want point business that, first couple years, would say cleaned business. now, position really starting perform us. businesses, very, much specific region, would four that, overall, would say, outperforming. want point three things. aggregate mexico, mexico across board, whether ppg comex industrial segment business protective coatings, protective marine, outperforming mexico. aggregate china, course excluding deco play, aggregate china, outperforming. aggregate india, except deco play, outperforming. so, that's would describe business feel confident performance going forward, chris. operator next question come line david begleiter deutsche bank. line open. please go ahead. david begleiter -- analyst thank you. good morning. tim, go review u.s. paint business, see disruption business? particular, seeing market share loss -- due challenge disruption business? thank you. timothy m. knavish -- chairman chief executive officer hey, dave. good quarter business. so, course, something -- know, concern announced it. internally, team done really good job working employees, customers, distribution partner private dealer space, big box customers. -- good quarter business, mid single-digit growth. so, -- something watching monitoring closely trying stay ahead it. say team really good job q2 that, expecting q3. there's lot discussions. course, there's anxieties, far, kind sizable impact financial results. operator next question come line john robert mizuho. line open. please go ahead. john robert -- analyst thank you, tim. still track silica sale well, feel rest specialty material portfolio? timothy m. knavish -- chairman chief executive officer yeah, john. thanks question. silicas, much track that, maybe even little ahead architectural u.s. canada. good interest well, let's say original schedule. rest specialty business really like. here's why. leadership position spaces, high technology spaces, right wheelhouse r&d capability standpoint. so, -- obviously, biggest part portfolio, business one good growth engine u q2. expect continue going forward. so, good business us. operator next question come line stephen byrne bank america merrill lynch. line open. please go ahead. steve byrne -- analyst yes, thank you. and, tim, clean slate report financials, 10 businesses, looming divestitures. report network businesses, would choose two segments, would allocate way currently arranged? would consider going path either segment reporting revenue business, something drive transparency? timothy m. knavish -- chairman chief executive officer hey, steve. know, something giving lot thought to, continue think see thing look like post-architectural usca. high level, group business essentially deliver factory factory, pure b2b type business go factory assembly plant factory directly paint shop kind. that's logical fit lot synergies, synergy operations, synergy raw materials, synergy supply chain logistics, synergy science technology. another group business largely go distribution lot value-add services, know, key part value proposition like aerospace, like refinish, like protective. so, high level, comfortable it, something look regular basis. take fresh look transaction done. -- know, pretty comfortable report today. operator next question come line vincent andrew morgan stanley. line open. please go ahead. vincent andrew -- analyst thank you, good morning. model, look 2025, start see raw material move probably low single digit first half next year. so, something look get ahead pricing perspective back half year, take wait-and-see approach? part business where, know, forget refinish aero well-defined pricing power, part business, maybe auto oem little concerned able pas through? timothy m. knavish -- chairman chief executive officer yeah. hey, vincent. so, would say high level there's sufficient capacity across supply chain. look total industry coatings, producing less liter pre-covid. so, there's -- high level, there's still quite bit capacity there. course, get ahead it. pointed place get ahead it. businesses, largely industrial segment, typically real time. cases, know, business able get pricing faster others. discussed last inflationary cycle, auto oem typically slowest, eventually get like last cycle. so, would expect play cycle may horizon, whether next year following year. operator next question come line michael sison well fargo. line open. please go ahead. mike sison -- analyst hey, good morning. maybe talk little bit profitability u.s. architectural paints? improvement last year? maybe type growth think business generate second half? finally, tim, think full sale, jv, partnership, thinking -- thinking one would best transaction shareholders? timothy m. knavish -- chairman chief executive officer well, -- know, -- best transaction shareholder come two pieces. one what's -- proceeds, get paid selling? two, what's long-term strategic value anything might left with? so, that's really hard u say here's best shareholder value proposal right combination two, price, proceeds, future value anything might left with, yet process. that's thinking about. combination shareholder value today, get, shareholder value future, fit growth strategy expect earnings cash flow long term. vincent j. morale -- senior vice president, chief financial officer yeah. and, mike, current events, look, tim said earlier question, business performing well. volume key driver profitability. know, volume q2 said prepared remarks, pleased progress year date. operator next question come line frank mitsch fermium research. line open. please go ahead. frank mitsch -- analyst good morning, congrats, alex, new role. tim, want -- want ask expectation second half lower previously thought, resulted full-year eps guide down. curious, know, roughly, -- think back three month ago even six month ago first put full-year projection, sort level volume growth expecting second half year? -- term expectation volume growth second half year? know part reduction tied auto oem. said surprised extension assembly plant downtime. curious, looking back ppg's history, surprised past auto oems taking extended assembly plant downtime, serve sort foreshadowing recessionary environment anything like that? color would helpful. thank you. timothy m. knavish -- chairman chief executive officer yeah. hey, frank. so, first all, changed saying full year saying today. largely couple big business like auto global architectural europe and, course, business put takes, up, down. so, that's really biggest, biggest driver. second question, using recession word all. see temporary adjustment assembly plant given vehicle -- certain vehicle selling less expected inventory going little bit. inventory still healthy compared pre-covid levels, look u.s. inventories, -- creep little bit. so, think there's adjustment. there's caution customer affordability, interest rates, thing really drive vehicle purchase behavior consumers. know, probably prediction interest rates. mine, point, pressure come new car purchases. think customer watching thing closely, inventory versus affordability interest rates. -- see foreshadowing recession kind. operator next question come line patrick cunningham citigroup. line open. please go ahead. patrick cunningham -- citi -- analyst hi, good morning. curious optimism refinish outlook second half. know, region expect see meaningful growth?

         "Ara Mahdessian and Vahe Kuzoyan had a simple plan after graduating from college: Write some software that could assist their dads with all the paperwork that comes with being a contractor. Two decades later, that idea has morphed into a Glendale company called ServiceTitan, which last year served some 8,000 plumbing, HVAC, janitorial and other firms with a soup-to-nuts software suite — and now plans to go public on Nasdaq under the ticker “TTAN.” The tech company, which has raised about $1.4 billion in funding since its 2007 founding, did not disclose in the Nov. 18 filing how many shares it plans to sell or how much capital it wants to raise. A spokesperson declined to comment. The initial public offering of stock marks a significant step for the company, which had filed confidential paperwork for an $18-billion offering in 2022, according to Business Insider, but didn’t move forward after the Federal Reserve sharply raised interest rates to combat inflation, freezing up the IPO market. ServiceTitan — which makes most of its money charging a subscription for its services — reported revenue of $614 million in the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, up nearly a third from a year earlier; and a loss of $195 million, 28% less than in fiscal 2023. It had about $147 million in cash and equivalents on hand as of Jan. 31, 2024, and was carrying $175 million in long-term net debt. The company, which serves contractors nationwide, says it wants to expand the number of trades and markets it serves. It employed 2,870 workers as of July 31 at its Glendale headquarters and t offices elsewhere in the U.S. and internationally. ServiceTitan has developed a web-based software that can manage all aspects of a contractor’s business, including booking appointments, generating estimates, processing invoices as well as payroll and dispatching workers. Clients range in size from family-owned contractors to large national franchises. It estimates it receives about 1% of what its clients charge their own customers, which totaled $62 billion in the 12 months that ended July 31. Competitors include BuildOps , Housecall Pro, Jobber and other companies that charge subscriptions for their web-based business management software. The founders immigrated to the United States in the 1980s as children: Mahdessian, 39, from Iran and Kuzoyan, 41, from Armenia. Mahdessian’s father started a contracting business, and Kuzoyan’s, plumbing. Mahdessian went off to Stanford and Kuzoyan got into USC, with the pair meeting at an Armenian students event. After graduation, they started in 2007 building a simple program to track customer calls and marketing budgets, but their venture soon attracted other contractors. The duo scored a seed round of funding from Mucker Capital in 2014. ServiceTitan also has gone on to make acquisitions and raise more than $1 billion from Iconiq Growth , Bessemer Venture Partners, Battery Ventures and others. Iconiq is the largest institutional shareholder of ServiceTitan, holding 24% of Class A shares. The company’s share structure will ensure that control remains with the founders — Mahdessian is chief executive and Kuzoyan president — who will retain all Class B shares, which are entitled to 10 votes each. Meritech Capital, in an analysis of the offering , said ServiceTitan appears to be eager to go public due to an unusual provision of its $365-million funding round in November 2022 when money was harder to come by. A so-called “IPO ratchet” protected participants by guaranteeing them more shares should the company’s IPO price decline below its funding-round valuation. PitchBook valued the company at $7.6 billion at the time, meaning the IPO needs to trade above a “base” of $84.57 per share or ServiceTitan will have to issue more shares, Meritech said. The base per share price also compounds after a certain time, making it more difficult for the IPO price to exceed it. “ServiceTitan is incentivized to get public ASAP,” Meritech stated in its report. Lead underwriters on the IPO are Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. The offering is expected to be watched closely for signs that the IPO market is making a comeback.",

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable operating income result versus guidance revenue outperformance, including high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. net income third quarter $98.1 million $1.16 per share, based 84.2 million diluted weighted average share outstanding. compare net income $79.1 million $0.96 per share 83.7 million diluted weighted-average share outstanding year-ago period. turning balance sheet cash flow, ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. full-fiscal year 2025, expect revenue range $1.973 billion $1.977 billion, non-gaap income operation range $242 million $245 million, non-gaap net income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, will. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line rudy kessinger da davidson. please go ahead. rudy kessinger -- analyst hey guys, thanks squeezing here. believe last quarter said consumption growth slightly ahead expectations. slower year-over-year growth versus q2 last year, year-over-year growth improve q1. so, guess curious q3, could make comment regard? obviously, slower year-over-year basis q3 last year, stable year-over-year consumption growth q2 better worse? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. rudy, thanks question. specifically called relative q2. see lower year-over-year growth called out. see seasonal rebound. usually q3 stronger q2 talked smaller prior year. hopefully, help triangulate. rudy kessinger -- analyst okay. quick follow-up. believe q4 call back march. point, dev, said would least another year ai application deployed scale. sound like commentary early large workloads, thousands, many large scale. guess, expectation maybe still least another year seeing broad ai application rollouts scale? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think lot function what's happening r&d side ai, right? example, today, compelling model designed phones, right, today phone computing horsepower run complex models. so, see ton very, successful consumer apps besides, say, chatgpt claude. -- also see like hundred apps taking like saw kind first generation like internet cloud era, right, mobile era. like think still early day ai. see lot people building ai apps, lot kind fairly rudimentary functionality. think time that's going change. fact, know change. can't predict happen. see apps production, traction, seeing grow very, quickly lot platform. really meaningful. operator thank you. concludes today's q&a session. would like go ahead turn call back dev closing remarks. please go ahead. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you, everyone. wanted say really pleased q3 result strong new business performance revenue exceeding expectation -- across atlas ea. making necessary investment expand enterprise channel see largest opportunity establish mongodb standard strongest return go-to-market investments. looking ahead, encouraged progress making accelerating legacy app modernization ai well establishing standard emerging ai tech stack greenfield ai applications. last least, would like thank michael contribution past 10 year wish well. thank you, everyone, talk soon. operator [operator

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, will. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line rudy kessinger da davidson. please go ahead. rudy kessinger -- analyst hey guys, thanks squeezing here. believe last quarter said consumption growth slightly ahead expectations. slower year-over-year growth versus q2 last year, year-over-year growth improve q1. so, guess curious q3, could make comment regard? obviously, slower year-over-year basis q3 last year, stable year-over-year consumption growth q2 better worse? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. rudy, thanks question. specifically called relative q2. see lower year-over-year growth called out. see seasonal rebound. usually q3 stronger q2 talked smaller prior year. hopefully, help triangulate. rudy kessinger -- analyst okay. quick follow-up. believe q4 call back march. point, dev, said would least another year ai application deployed scale. sound like commentary early large workloads, thousands, many large scale. guess, expectation maybe still least another year seeing broad ai application rollouts scale? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think lot function what's happening r&d side ai, right? example, today, compelling model designed phones, right, today phone computing horsepower run complex models. so, see ton very, successful consumer apps besides, say, chatgpt claude. -- also see like hundred apps taking like saw kind first generation like internet cloud era, right, mobile era. like think still early day ai. see lot people building ai apps, lot kind fairly rudimentary functionality. think time that's going change. fact, know change. can't predict happen. see apps production, traction, seeing grow very, quickly lot platform. really meaningful. operator thank you. concludes today's q&a session. would like go ahead turn call back dev closing remarks. please go ahead. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you, everyone. wanted say really pleased q3 result strong new business performance revenue exceeding expectation -- across atlas ea. making necessary investment expand enterprise channel see largest opportunity establish mongodb standard strongest return go-to-market investments. looking ahead, encouraged progress making accelerating legacy app modernization ai well establishing standard emerging ai tech stack greenfield ai applications. last least, would like thank michael contribution past 10 year wish well. thank you, everyone, talk soon. operator [operator

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

seat seven year elastic, cfo coo, driving fairly turbulent change inside elastic. so, got battle star pushing inside company get change done inside, like that. like lot. also got good early experience company feel always added value autodesk. so, vmware senior position. cisco senior position. good success bringing people kind companies. worked company driving optimization scale, no. 1 criterion looking driving work. also another nice have. got knowledge industry. spent two year ptc career. actually recently ptc board. so, understands industry, able get speed pretty quickly. no. 1 goal drive optimization scale next years, make sure getting everything need every dollar invest, important theme autodesk. that, really excited, looking forward joining december. jason celino -- analyst ok. great. interesting. second question, cfo, thought might hold next investor day? think past, usually march. good time frame? soon? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. well, janesh joining december. think need give time get sea leg giving time kind drive end year actually get u set next fiscal year good stead. so, would say unlikely anything spring, get back soon janesh ready talk things. operator thank you. next question come line jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities. question, please. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank you. andrew, third quarter, three-year cagr current rpo 12%. thinking sustainability perhaps improvement upon cagr crpo next number years? think ingredient that, look like last several years, cagr unit volume brand roughly 6% 7% aggregate. so, top that, price ingredients, perhaps talk think might able improve upon recent trajectory current rpo. follow-up. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. hi, jay, betsy. let give couple things. there's number thing going on, headline crpo number. first take away headwind tailwind broadly consistent second quarter. mentioned opening commentary, early renewal growth -- new transaction model providing tailwind. there's also headwind crpo growth declining contribution billed unbilled deferred revenue risk large multiyear eba cohort coming renewal fiscal '26. reminder, larger cohort calling tailwind free cash flow next year. look back fiscal '22, saw dynamic ahead fiscal '23 renewal well. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst ok. since new management part news evening, could talk thinking chief revenue officer position. would make sense perhaps continue separate cro? think might make sense perhaps combine cro coo? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, going continue separate cro various function work together coo organization, including organization, infrastructure thing associated. looking cro someone understands continue drive business direct engagement customer. so, mean someone really understands take analyze self-service patterns, actually understand data come customer help drive cross-sell upsell also transforming channel transactionally focused extension autodesk kind solution partner that's driving life cycle solution customers. so, that's kind role looking here. yes, going continue stand-alone cro role within coo organization. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank much. operator thank you. next question come line adam borg stifel. line open. adam borg -- analyst awesome. thanks much taking questions, congrats betsy janesh. maybe new transaction model. know still early. curious, learning customer new model seeing term adoption autodesk technology ability find white space better upsell cross-sell different solution direct relationship. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, adam, really early able make kind conclusion that. tell definitely see shift direct channel autodesk customer probably served kind arm's length kind transactional level. term driving cross-sell upsell, early days, early days. want get sense might evolve, got experience ebas enterprise business agreements. learned year kind relationship customer really understand usage patterns, doing, much effective driving cross-sell upsell even partnering channel partners. so, think kind stand testament what's possible move forward completion new transaction model. adam borg -- analyst great. maybe quick follow-up. think new administration coming in, talked macro broadly consistent. change tone conversation end market term optimism ability willingness expand new project ahead administration? pause full steam ahead? curious, commentary macro perspective would really, really helpful. thanks much. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director say thing matter customer bipartisan things, right? customer care infrastructure build out. party care infrastructure build-outs. customer care domestic manufacturing europe, united states, party agree domestic manufacturing build-outs important. supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. thing bipartisan issue really affect customers. so, regardless administration, suspect thing important customer continuing focus. adam borg -- analyst thanks, again. operator thank you. next question come line joe vruwink baird. please go ahead, joe. joe vruwink -- analyst thank you. outlook next year, $2.050 billion free cash has, think, expectation past year now. within last year, also seen co-term contracts. think lead better billing fy '26. so, question is, actually create potential thing better, that's qualifying $2.050 billion midpoint possibilities. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer there's change talked free cash flow guide fiscal '26, continues $2.05 billion mid-point. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. fair enough. m&a environment, recent history, autodesk mode of, would say, strategic tuck-ins. think actually asset cfd simulation space announced au quarter. right approach autodesk, given point time, work done build cloud platform, data models, tuck-ins make sense? that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. elizabeth, betsy. so, broadly speaking, continue see growth, slower pace due number factor really last several years, macro, covid, exiting russia, elections, drag forward momentum business, really factored guidance. so, kind leave that. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. follow-up billings. understand there's lot volatility around change multiyear transaction model. look like guidance implies bigger step growth q4, despite easier year-ago compare. so, hoping could help u unpack balance headwind tailwind would drive kind greater downtick growth q4. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, again, let start fiscal '25 perspective. billing tailwind going final shift annual billings, new transaction model early renewals. going get headwind co-terming business booked ahead new transaction model launch recent weeks, fx. so, again, think continued perform well executed q3. so, think feel very, strongly expectation q4. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line bhavin shah deutsche bank. question please, bhavin. bhavin shah -- analyst great, thanks taking question, congrats quarter. andrew, university, appeared noticeable uptick attendance session geared toward owner operators. driving recent interest segment?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

         "Rohit Chopra may not have much time left as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with Donald Trump preparing to assume the presidency. But the regulator has been making the most of his likely final months on the job, telling Congress recently he didn’t think there was any reason for the agency to act like a “dead fish.” This week, the CFPB took a flurry of small actions involving the credit card industry. Among the actions: It warned companies that devaluing customers’ points might be illegal and released a study knocking retail credit cards for offering particularly high interest rates. It also debuted a new credit card comparison tool using data the agency collects that, in theory, could offer an alternative to commercial sites that it argues often rely on kickbacks or affiliate marketing. In an interview on Thursday, Chopra told Yahoo Finance that the credit card industry has a growing price-gouging problem and shared some of his thoughts on regulations that may be needed to curb it — even if it may be a while before another Democrat has a chance to implement them. Below is a transcript of the interview, which has been edited for length and clarity. Weissmann : I want to take a step back. In general, how would you describe the way the credit card industry is currently treating consumers? Is its whole business model fundamentally problematic or are there just a bunch of discrete issues that need better regulation, in your view? Chopra : I think the most noteworthy shift in recent years has been what many would consider price gouging. Very importantly, we have seen a shift in the margins on credit card interest rates. In other words, when you look at the cost of funds for big credit card issuers, and you look at other factors like consumer credit profiles, we’re seeing much fatter margins. And in some ways credit cards have been more expensive than at any time in recent history. So just to put a finer point on it: Even when you consider [the Fed’s] interest rate hikes, those credit card interest rates went well beyond that. The net result is that as consumers were walking down the aisle and wondering why things like diapers were so expensive, when they were swiping those purchases with a credit card, they were once again getting hit with high prices. Weissmann : What is your theory about why those margins have gotten so much fatter? What's allowing them to engage in “price gouging,” as you put it? Chopra : There's a whole host of reasons and we've looked at many of them. Some of them range from real in-the-weeds type practices, like how they've changed their credit reporting to obscure to their competitors who their most profitable customers are , to things that are much more in the open. And one of those things is the major role that rewards cards have now played in the market. You now see that rewards cards are not just being marketed to higher-income, prime borrowers. You're seeing it penetrate across the marketplace. Consumers are really looking at choosing a credit card based on the rewards. That’s created a market environment where the interest rate itself is less salient, and the interest rates that people are paying often wipe out way more than the value of the rewards. We've looked at this also from other angles, including how so many non-financial companies have essentially turned into credit card companies. We have department stores out there that are largely staying afloat because they're churning credit cards. Weissmann : You guys put out this credit card comparison tool. When I went online and tried it out, what struck me initially is that you can’t compare rewards very well on it, which is what most credit card shoppers — like you said — are interested in. What it does make easy is comparing the APR. I’m curious, was that intentional? Was that a way of signaling people should care more about interest rates? Or was it a limitation of the data? Chopra : So here is what I would say about the tool. As you can tell, it’s not so fancy. But what we're really trying to do is make the data public. Based on what we've done the past few years, we’re ordering companies to require data and then allowing people to visualize it with the goal that third-party comparison sites will also make use of this data. And it's going to be updated periodically. But you're right that the way consumers are looking at it now, it's mostly based on rewards, and I’m really concerned that the structure of credit cards today creates a financial incentive for credit card companies to push consumers into a treadmill of debt. Because when you’re signing up for a credit card, it’s typically a time when you feel you can pay off your balance month to month, and that means the interest rate is a lot less salient. You're then focused on the sign-up bonus for the rewards, which is very natural. And what we find is that when people start paying interest on credit cards, we are not seeing those credit card issuers fess up to consumers that they can switch to a card with a lower rate. The fundamental issue is credit card companies profit when people get into debt. Weissmann: There are obviously a lot of these comparison tools online. Why do you feel like we need another one? Chopra: We’ve done work and issued policy about rigged comparison sites. We think comparison tools are very important, but when the results are rigged, it ends up steering consumers into cards that may simply be profitable for the comparison website. And manipulated results are something that we've been increasing our scrutiny over. I’ll give one example: You have a lot of airline points websites, not operated by airlines, operated by third parties who are actually making enormous sums of money through commissions and kickbacks from credit card companies. So part of it was again trying to make the data available so that there is some unbiased data set and that there is at least someplace where people can go where it's not skewed. Are we expecting tons of eyeballs on this? No, but we have found that making the data public so that it can be used and power other sorts of tools is really important. Weissmann: You put out a report arguing that retailers are essentially responsible for a disproportionate share of the problems and bad debt in the industry. Do you think retail credit cards need more specific regulations? Chopra: One of the places that we have heard a lot from is retail workers. I've also heard this from flight attendants and others that an increasing amount of their compensation is now tied to whether or not they can push credit cards on customers. When that moves into high-pressure tactics and quotas, that can often be a recipe for what we saw at places like Wells Fargo, that even created fake accounts. So trying to make sure that there isn't too much pressure or coercion on frontline workers to push these cards, I think, could be something that we continue to do. Weissmann: Donald Trump talked about imposing a cap on credit card interest rates during his campaign. Do you think that would be an appropriate move? Chopra: I do think that there's a growing consensus about the need for interest rate caps. We've done research to show that the rates that are being charged by the largest and most dominant credit card issuers are substantially higher than credit card issuers that may not be popular name brands. We've also looked at credit unions who are subject to a federal rate cap on their credit cards and many of them have very robust businesses. So I think that's something that the incoming administration is clearly interested in and I think that's going to be a place where there's going to be more bipartisan discussion.

         "Boeing Co. BA is back in the spotlight after a Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korea’s JejuAir crashed at Muan International Airport on Sunday, tragically killing 179 of 181 passengers and raising fresh questions about the aerospace manufacturer's safety record. What Happened : The crash comes amid Boeing’s ongoing challenges, including a 30% stock decline in 2024 and production restrictions imposed by federal regulators following January’s Alaska Airlines door plug incident on a 737 MAX aircraft, reported Associated Press on Sunday. JejuAir’s shares plunged 7.67% to 7,570 ($5.14) South Korean won following the crash, while Boeing’s stock, already down 28.22% year-to-date, faces uncertain trading as markets process the incident’s implications. Aviation consultant and former Delta Air Lines chief pilot Alan Price emphasized that the 737-800 involved in Sunday’s crash differs from the troubled MAX variant, calling it “a very proven airplane” with a strong safety record. “We are in contact with Jeju Air regarding flight 2216 and stand ready to support them. We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew,” Boeing wrote on X on Sunday. pic.twitter.com/TIrIUBw4RB See Also: Veteran Investor Bets Big On S&P 500 Hitting 7,000 By End Of 2025: These Sectors Could Lead The Charge Why It Matters : The incident adds to Boeing’s recent setbacks, including a seven-week machinists strike that disrupted production of key aircraft models and January’s FAA manufacturing oversight restrictions. The company has struggled to rebuild its reputation following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people and led to $23 billion in losses. Under new leadership since CEO David Calhoun ‘s departure in August, Boeing has initiated safety improvement discussions among 70,000 employees. The cause of Sunday’s crash remains under investigation by South Korean authorities. Market analysts note that while distinct from previous 737 MAX issues, the crash could further impact investor confidence in Boeing as it competes with European rival Airbus for market share in the commercial aviation sector. Price Action : Boeing Co.’s stock is trading down 4.15% at $173.50 during Robinhood’s overnight trading service. On Friday, the stock closed at $180.72, up 0.19% for the day, before edging higher by 0.10% in after-hours trading to $180.90. Year to date, Boeing’s stock has fallen significantly, down 28.22%, according to data from Benzinga Pro . Boeing has a consensus price target of $197.85 from 23 analysts, with a high of $260 and a low of $85. The latest ratings from JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and RBC Capital average $158.33, implying a 12.47% downside. Boeing’s 30-day average trading volume stands at 10.71 million shares, with a 52-week range of $137.03 to $264.66. The company has a market capitalization of $135.34 billion, and its 14-day Relative Strength Index is at 77.4, indicating overbought conditions.

         "The U.S. housing market has been tumultuous due to persistent interest rate hikes . However, an upward revision of U.S. gross domestic product growth in the second quarter has led speculators to reconsider their bets on a substantial 50-basis-point rate cut next month. With mortgage rates expected to decrease, experts advise homebuyers to act swiftly to secure the best deals before the opportunity closes. Looking ahead, several dynamic trends are set to shape the housing market. According to a note by Norada Real Estate Investments, the market will remain strong over the next five years, though it will experience some dramatic shifts. Home prices are projected to continue rising, but at a slower pace than in recent years, offering a more gradual increase. While the supply of homes is expected to grow, addressing the previous shortage should ease the inventory crunch that has driven prices up. Also Read: A Ton Of Landlords Are About To Raise Rents This Year Despite the Federal Reserve’s past rate hikes raising borrowing costs and dampening buyer enthusiasm, a gradual rate decline could rekindle demand and revitalize the market. However, competition will remain fierce due to robust job growth, population expansion, and limited land availability. 2024 Forecast The U.S. housing market is anticipated to slow, with home prices either stabilizing or seeing a slight decline. Zillow’s latest forecast for 2024 projects a 1.8% national increase in home values, indicating a period of market stability, Norada Real Estate Investments added. Stock Opportunities As home prices are expected to remain stable or increase modestly, homebuilders are likely to benefit from sustained demand and favorable conditions. This stability should support their revenue growth through ongoing construction and sales. According to a June report by the National Association of Home Builders , the top three homebuilders by revenue, closings, and home types are: D.R. Horton, Inc .

The Company will be subject to income tax on taxable income that is not distributed and to an excise tax to the extent that a certain percentage of its taxable income is not distributed by specified dates. The Company has not established a minimum distribution payment level and is not assured of its ability to make distributions to stockholders in the future. As of July 10, 2024, the Company had 66,849,374 shares of common stock outstanding. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had 64,824,374 shares of common stock outstanding. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had 52,826,169 shares of common stock outstanding. Estimated June 30, 2024 Book Value Per Share The Company's estimated book value per share as of June 30, 2024 was $8.58. The Company computes book value per share by dividing total stockholders' equity by the total number of outstanding shares of common stock. At June 30, 2024, the Company's preliminary estimated total stockholders' equity was approximately $555.9 million with 64,824,374 shares of common stock outstanding. These figures and the resulting estimated book value per share are preliminary, subject to change, and subject to review by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Estimated Net Loss Per Share and Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses on RMBS and Derivative Instruments The Company estimates it generated a net loss per share of $0.09 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which includes an estimated $0.1 million of net realized and unrealized gains on RMBS and derivative instruments. These amounts compare to total dividends declared during the quarter of $0.36 per share. Net income (loss) per common share calculated under generally accepted accounting principles can, and does, differ from our REIT taxable income. The Company views REIT taxable income as a better indication of income to be paid in the form of a dividend rather than net income. Many components of REIT taxable income can only be estimated at this time and our monthly dividends declared are based on both estimates of REIT taxable income to be earned over the course of the current quarter and calendar year and a longer-term estimate of the REIT taxable income of the Company. These figures are preliminary, subject to change, and subject to review by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Estimated Total Return on Equity The Company's estimated total return on equity for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was (2.0)%. The Company calculates total return on equity as the sum of dividends declared and paid during the quarter plus changes in book value during the quarter, divided by the Company's stockholders' equity at the beginning of the quarter. The total return was $(0.18) per share, comprised of dividends per share of $0.36 and a decrease in book value per share of $0.54 from March 31, 2024. RMBS Portfolio Characteristics Details of the RMBS portfolio as of June 30, 2024 are presented below. These figures are preliminary and subject to change and, with respect to figures that will appear in the Company's financial statements and associated footnotes as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, are subject to review by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm: RMBS Valuation Characteristics RMBS Assets by Agency Investment Company Act of 1940 (Whole Pool) Test Results Repurchase Agreement Exposure by Counterparty RMBS Risk Measures About Orchid Island Capital, Inc.

The first round of bank earnings for the second half concluded on Friday, showcasing generally better-than-expected results from three of the largest U.S. banks: JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM , Citigroup Inc. C , and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC . Despite the overall positive trend, market reactions were broadly negative, particularly for Wells Fargo, reflecting some specific concerns and risks. Read Also: JP Morgan Chase Q2 Earnings: Investment Banking Revenues Up 46%, CEO Jamie Dimon’s Cautious Comment And More JPMorgan The largest U.S. bank by assets, reported earnings per share (EPS) at $6.12, surpassing the consensus estimate of $4.29. Adjusted revenue reached $50.99 billion, slightly above the forecast of $50.2 billion. Loan balances were in line with expectations at $1.32 trillion Total deposits fell short at $2.4 trillion compared to the anticipated $2.43 trillion. Managed net interest income totaled $22.86 billion, slightly higher than the expected $22.82 billion. The provision for credit losses stood at $3.05 billion, above the estimated $2.83 billion. According to Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden, trading results exceeded consensus expectations by 7%, driven by a 2% increase in Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC) and a 15% rise in Equities. The year-over-year growth in trading, at 10%, surpassed the high end of the intra-quarter guidance, which had anticipated revenue growth to be slightly above the mid-single digits year-over-year. “We expect questions on the sustainability of trading going forward in a lower vol environment, and an update on the accelerating investment banking backdrop,” Ramsden wrote. CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the bank’s cautious outlook despite the strong performance. “While market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks. These tail risks are the same ones that we have mentioned before. The geopolitical situation remains complex and potentially the most dangerous since World War II — though its outcome and effect on the global economy remain unknown,” Dimon said. Dimon also addressed the issue of inflation. “There has been some progress bringing inflation down, but there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us: large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world. Therefore, inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase fell 1.9% minutes after the New York stock market opened. Wells Fargo Wells Fargo’s EPS at $1.33, slightly higher than the $1.29 expected by analysts. The bank’s revenue reached $20.69 billion, exceeding the $20.28-billion estimate. Total average deposits were close to expectations at $1.35 trillion Net interest income slightly below estimates at $11.92 billion compared to $12.12 billion anticipated. The commercial banking segment reported revenue of $3.12 billion, just shy of the $3.15 billion forecast.

Shares of Wells Fargo plummeted by 6.6%, on track for the worst session since mid-March 2023. Citi Citi’s EPS of $1.52 beat the estimated $1.39. Revenue of $20.14 billion, compared to the $20.11-billion forecast. Banking revenue was $1.63 billion, above the $1.55 billion estimate Wealth management revenue reached $1.81 billion, surpassing the expected $1.73 billion. U.S. personal banking revenue came in below estimates at $4.92 billion versus $5.12 billion expected. Citi CEO Jane Fraser emphasized the growth in client investment assets and the bank’s focus on rationalizing the expense base. “Our results show the progress we are making in executing our strategy and the benefit of our diversified business model,” she said. “We achieved positive operating leverage with revenue up 4% and a 2% decline in expenses.” Shares of Citigroup fell 1.9%, mimicking Thursday’s losses.

The first round of bank earnings for the second half concluded on Friday, showcasing generally better-than-expected results from three of the largest U.S. banks: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Despite the overall positive trend, market reactions were broadly negative, particularly for Wells Fargo, reflecting some specific concerns and risks.

Adjusted revenue reached $50.99 billion, slightly above the forecast of $50.2 billion. Loan balances were in line with expectations at $1.32 trillion Total deposits fell short at $2.4 trillion compared to the anticipated $2.43 trillion.

The year-over-year growth in trading, at 10%, surpassed the high end of the intra-quarter guidance, which had anticipated revenue growth to be slightly above the mid-single digits year-over-year. “We expect questions on the sustainability of trading going forward in a lower vol environment, and an update on the accelerating investment banking backdrop,” Ramsden wrote. CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the bank’s cautious outlook despite the strong performance. “While market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks. These tail risks are the same ones that we have mentioned before. The geopolitical situation remains complex and potentially the most dangerous since World War II — though its outcome and effect on the global economy remain unknown,” Dimon said. Dimon also addressed the issue of inflation. “There has been some progress bringing inflation down, but there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us: large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world. Therefore, inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase fell 1.9% minutes after the New York stock market opened.

Shares of Wells Fargo plummeted by 6.6%, on track for the worst session since mid-March 2023. Citi Citi’s EPS of $1.52 beat the estimated $1.39.

         "Electric vehicle company Rivian Automotive RIVN could provide an update on production and delivery guidance and share the impact the 2024 election outcome has on the company's future when third-quarter financial results are reported Thursday after market close. Earnings Estimates : Analysts expect Rivian to report third-quarter revenue of $1.00 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The revenue forecast is below last year's third-quarter total of $1.34 and would be the company's lowest revenue total in six quarters. Rivian has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in six straight quarters and seven of the past 10 quarters overall. Analysts expect the company to report a loss of 92 cents per share, compared to a loss of $1.19 in last year's third quarter. The company has beaten analyst estimates for earnings per share in eight straight quarters. What Analysts Are Saying: Softness in demand is a key area JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman is watching in the company's third-quarter financial report and commentary. The analyst has an Underweight rating on Rivian and recently lowered the price target from $14 to $12. Brinkman's update came after Rivian lowered its annual production guidance to a range of 47,000 to 49,000 vehicles, down from a previous guidance of 57,000 vehicles. The change came due to a shortage in a component that is disrupting production, according to the company. \"Interestingly, 2024 full-year deliveries guidance was reiterated at ~50-52K despite the production shortfall, implying unchanged demand, although we note that the softer deliveries in 3Q do not on the surface appear supply-related,\" Brinkman said. Rivian added 3,139 units to its inventory in the third quarter, marking one of the company's largest quarterly adds. The figure was higher than an average quarterly change of around 950 units, the analyst said, which could suggest soft demand. \"The softer trend to production (and possibly deliveries also) we think could endanger the company’s still growth stock multiple.\" Here are other recent analyst ratings for Rivian and their price targets: Guggenheim: Maintained a Buy rating and lowered the price target from $21 to $18 Mizuho : Maintained a Neutral rating and lowered the price target from $15 to $12 Truist : Maintained a Hold rating and lowered the price target from $16 to $12 Barclays : Maintained an Equal-Weight rating and lowered the price target from $16 to $13 Wells Fargo : Maintained an Equal-Weight rating and lowered the price target from $15 to 11 Key Items to Watch: Rivian's quarterly report will mark one of the first automotive companies to present earnings and comments after the 2024 election. Rivian stock fell Wednesday in the aftermath of Donald Trump winning the 2024 presidential election. While it's possible Rivian won't address the matte, analysts and investors would like to hear if the new presidency could hurt the overall electric vehicle company and what Rivian will be doing to address the concerns. The election win by Trump comes as Rivian faces a crossroads of increasing production capabilities ahead of the R2 launch planned for 2026 and could see lower production and delivery figures ahead of new vehicles. Another item Rivian may not address would be the competition from companies like Tesla . Rivian was mentioned as a buyout candidate to Tesla CEO Elon Musk , but he said the company wasn't interested and suggested potential struggles ahead. \"Rivian's going to have a hard time,\" Musk said. Musk previously predicted in February 2024 that Rivian had around six quarters before it went bankrupt. A joint venture with Volkswagen VWAGY worth up to $5 billion could help Rivian's financials. Investors and analysts could also get an update on this joint venture Thursday. RIVN Price Action: Rivian stock is up 5.07% to $10.20 on Thursday versus a 52-week trading range of $8.26 to $24.61. Rivian stock is down 53% year-to-date in 2024.

The Company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 660,000 shares of common stock. The offering was upsized from the previously announced offering size of 4,000,000 shares of common stock, and the offering is expected to close on or about October 28, 2024 . Citigroup and Wells Fargo Securities are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. The Company has entered into forward sale agreements with Citibank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the \"forward purchasers\") with respect to 4,400,000 shares of its common stock (or an aggregate of 5,060,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full).

Although these forward-looking statements are based on good faith beliefs, reasonable assumptions and the Company's best judgment reflecting current information, you should not rely on forward-looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond the Company's control and which could materially affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, performance or future achievements or events. Currently, one of the most significant factors, however, is the adverse effect of macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and the potential impacts of pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies or fear of such events on the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance of the Company and its tenants, the real estate market and the global economy and financial markets. The extent to which macroeconomic trends may impact us and our tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Moreover, investors are cautioned to interpret many of the risks identified in the risk factors discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other SEC filings, as well as the risks set forth below, as being heightened as a result of the ongoing and numerous adverse impacts of macroeconomic conditions. Additional important factors, among others, that may cause the Company's actual results to vary include the general deterioration in national economic conditions, weakening of real estate markets, decreases in the availability of credit, increases in interest rates, adverse changes in the retail industry, the Company's continuing ability to qualify as a REIT and other factors discussed in the Company's reports filed with the SEC.

         "ROYAL OAK, Mich. , Oct. 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Agree Realty Corporation ADC (the \"Company\") today announced the pricing of its public offering of 4,400,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $74.00 per share in connection with the forward sale agreements described below. The Company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 660,000 shares of common stock. The offering was upsized from the previously announced offering size of 4,000,000 shares of common stock, and the offering is expected to close on or about October 28, 2024 . Citigroup and Wells Fargo Securities are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. The Company has entered into forward sale agreements with Citibank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the \"forward purchasers\") with respect to 4,400,000 shares of its common stock (or an aggregate of 5,060,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). In connection with the forward sale agreements, the forward purchasers or their affiliates are expected to borrow and sell to the underwriters an aggregate of 4,400,000 shares of the common stock that will be delivered in this offering (or an aggregate of 5,060,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). Subject to its right to elect cash or net share settlement, which right is subject to certain conditions, the Company intends to deliver, upon physical settlement of such forward sale agreements on one or more dates specified by the Company occurring no later than December 31, 2025 , an aggregate of 4,400,000 shares of its common stock (or an aggregate of 5,060,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full) to the forward purchasers in exchange for cash proceeds per share equal to the applicable forward sale price, which will be the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions, and will be subject to certain adjustments as provided in the forward sale agreements. The Company will not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of its common stock by the forward purchasers. The Company expects to use the net proceeds, if any, it receives upon the future settlement of the forward sale agreements for general corporate purposes, including to fund property acquisitions and development activity or the repayment of outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility. Selling common stock through the forward sale agreements enables the Company to set the price of such shares upon pricing the offering (subject to certain adjustments) while delaying the issuance of such shares and the receipt of the net proceeds by the Company until the expected funding requirements described above have occurred. Copies of the prospectus supplement relating to this offering, when available, may be obtained by contacting: Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions, 1155 Long Island Avenue, Edgewood, NY 11717 (Tel: 800-831-9146) or Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Attention: WFS Customer Service, 608 2nd Avenue South, Suite 1000, Minneapolis, MN 55402, at 800-645-3751 or email: wfscustomerservice@wellsfargo.com .

         "Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by 50 basis points at its September Federal Open Market Committee meeting, lowering the federal funds rate in the range of 4.75%-5% . The Fed also hinted at the potential for additional cuts in the coming months, with the updated dot plot revealing a more aggressive rate-cutting trajectory than forecasted in June . Morgan Stanley economists anticipate an additional 150 basis points of rate reductions by mid-2025, with the U.S. economy steering clear of a recession. Morgan Stanley highlights the banks expected to see the greatest net interest margin (NIM) expansion or compression through the end of 2025, based on the projection that short-term rates will decrease by 200 basis points. Midcap banks are in a stronger position as they experienced greater pressure on deposit costs (higher deposit betas) when interest rates increased. They anticipate this pressure to ease at a similar pace as rates fall. Also, midcap banks hold more fixed-rate assets that were issued when rates were much lower in 2021 and 2022, allowing for higher repricing even as rates decrease coupled with lower liquidity requirements. For midcap banks, the analyst identifies Prosperity Bancshares Inc. PB , rated Overweight, as offering the best risk-reward profile. The firm is expected to experience one of the largest net interest margin (NIM) expansions through the fourth quarter of 2025, driven by the upward repricing of fixed-rate loans and securities. Similarly, Cadence Bank CADE , newly rated Overweight, is projected to benefit from a significant rise in NIM as deposit costs decline. It has minimal exposure to floating-rate loans and net cash, which tend to weigh on earnings when interest rates drop. While M&T Bank Corp MTB , the analyst’s top pick, ranks in the middle of the group, Morgan Stanley writes that future rate cuts will slightly boost NIM—a view that contrasts with the broader market consensus, which sees rate cuts as a long-term negative for margins. Rate cuts are advantageous for the seven major large-cap banks sensitive to liabilities. These money center banks also have significant revenue exposure to capital markets, likely boosting fee income growth in a low-rate, soft-landing scenario. Morgan Stanley expects this environment to strongly support M&A and Equity Capital Markets (ECM) activity. Additionally, lower rates are generally a credit positive for the banking sector. For large-cap banks, Morgan Stanley holds an Overweight rating on Citigroup Inc C , Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS , and Bank of America Corp BAC , citing expectations for a rebound in capital markets revenues amid a lower-rate environment and a sharp increase in buybacks following the Basel Endgame reproposal. Regions Financial Corp RF and U.S. Bancorp USB are favored due to their liability sensitivity and commercial and industrial loan growth potential to accelerate post-rate cuts. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo & Co WFC is highlighted for its strong excess capital levels and the possibility of progress on lifting its asset cap, which could favorably tilt the risk-reward outlook.

Morgan Stanley economists anticipate an additional 150 basis points of rate reductions by mid-2025, with the U.S. economy steering clear of a recession. Morgan Stanley highlights the banks expected to see the greatest net interest margin (NIM) expansion or compression through the end of 2025, based on the projection that short-term rates will decrease by 200 basis points. Midcap banks are in a stronger position as they experienced greater pressure on deposit costs (higher deposit betas) when interest rates increased. They anticipate this pressure to ease at a similar pace as rates fall. Also, midcap banks hold more fixed-rate assets that were issued when rates were much lower in 2021 and 2022, allowing for higher repricing even as rates decrease coupled with lower liquidity requirements. For midcap banks, the analyst identifies Prosperity Bancshares Inc. PB , rated Overweight, as offering the best risk-reward profile. The firm is expected to experience one of the largest net interest margin (NIM) expansions through the fourth quarter of 2025, driven by the upward repricing of fixed-rate loans and securities. Similarly, Cadence Bank CADE , newly rated Overweight, is projected to benefit from a significant rise in NIM as deposit costs decline. It has minimal exposure to floating-rate loans and net cash, which tend to weigh on earnings when interest rates drop. While M&T Bank Corp MTB , the analyst’s top pick, ranks in the middle of the group, Morgan Stanley writes that future rate cuts will slightly boost NIM—a view that contrasts with the broader market consensus, which sees rate cuts as a long-term negative for margins. Rate cuts are advantageous for the seven major large-cap banks sensitive to liabilities. These money center banks also have significant revenue exposure to capital markets, likely boosting fee income growth in a low-rate, soft-landing scenario. Morgan Stanley expects this environment to strongly support M&A and Equity Capital Markets (ECM) activity. Additionally, lower rates are generally a credit positive for the banking sector. For large-cap banks, Morgan Stanley holds an Overweight rating on Citigroup Inc C , Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS , and Bank of America Corp BAC , citing expectations for a rebound in capital markets revenues amid a lower-rate environment and a sharp increase in buybacks following the Basel Endgame reproposal. Regions Financial Corp RF and U.S. Bancorp USB are favored due to their liability sensitivity and commercial and industrial loan growth potential to accelerate post-rate cuts. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo & Co WFC is highlighted for its strong excess capital levels and the possibility of progress on lifting its asset cap, which could favorably tilt the risk-reward outlook.

         "The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both achieved record highs this week. A strong kickoff to the third-quarter earnings season fueled both indexes, offsetting concerns from last month's unexpected inflation surge. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM , Wells Fargo & Co. WFC , Bank of New York Mellon Corp. BK and BlackRock Inc. BLK all exceeded analyst earnings forecasts Friday. This triggered a stock rally and propelled the financial sector to new highs. In contrast, Tesla Inc. TSLA faced investor disappointment. The Austin, Texas-based car company is one of the worst performers within the S&P 500 this week. The much-anticipated \"We, Robot\" event on Thursday was partly to blame. The presentation failed to impress analysts and investors, alike. Critics said it was more fanfare than substance . While the company showcased its CyberCab and Optimus robot, key details about commercialization and timelines were lacking. The event sparked mixed reactions from investors, with concerns about whether Tesla can deliver on its ambitious autonomous vehicle promises. As a result, the Elon Musk -led EV manufacturer saw its share price plunge Friday . You might have missed... Economic data disappoints September inflation reports for both consumers and producers come in higher than expected, while jobless claims posted the sharpest rise in over a year. Despite the inflation uptick, interest rate expectations remained largely unchanged, with most traders and economists maintaining their outlook for a November rate cut .

         "The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both achieved record highs this week. A strong kickoff to the third-quarter earnings season fueled both indexes, offsetting concerns from last month's unexpected inflation surge. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM , Wells Fargo & Co. WFC , Bank of New York Mellon Corp. BK and BlackRock Inc. BLK all exceeded analyst earnings forecasts Friday. This triggered a stock rally and propelled the financial sector to new highs. In contrast, Tesla Inc. TSLA faced investor disappointment. The Austin, Texas-based car company is one of the worst performers within the S&P 500 this week. The much-anticipated \"We, Robot\" event on Thursday was partly to blame. The presentation failed to impress analysts and investors, alike. Critics said it was more fanfare than substance . While the company showcased its CyberCab and Optimus robot, key details about commercialization and timelines were lacking. The event sparked mixed reactions from investors, with concerns about whether Tesla can deliver on its ambitious autonomous vehicle promises. As a result, the Elon Musk -led EV manufacturer saw its share price plunge Friday . You might have missed... Economic data disappoints September inflation reports for both consumers and producers come in higher than expected, while jobless claims posted the sharpest rise in over a year. Despite the inflation uptick, interest rate expectations remained largely unchanged, with most traders and economists maintaining their outlook for a November rate cut . The unemployment spike was attributed to temporary factors, including Michigan auto layoffs and Hurricane Helene. No Stimulus Measures In China Chinese stocks saw their worst weekly performance of the year.

The Company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 660,000 shares of common stock. The offering was upsized from the previously announced offering size of 4,000,000 shares of common stock, and the offering is expected to close on or about October 28, 2024 . Citigroup and Wells Fargo Securities are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. The Company has entered into forward sale agreements with Citibank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the \"forward purchasers\") with respect to 4,400,000 shares of its common stock (or an aggregate of 5,060,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). In connection with the forward sale agreements, the forward purchasers or their affiliates are expected to borrow and sell to the underwriters an aggregate of 4,400,000 shares of the common stock that will be delivered in this offering (or an aggregate of 5,060,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full).

The Company expects to use the net proceeds, if any, it receives upon the future settlement of the forward sale agreements for general corporate purposes, including to fund property acquisitions and development activity or the repayment of outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility. Selling common stock through the forward sale agreements enables the Company to set the price of such shares upon pricing the offering (subject to certain adjustments) while delaying the issuance of such shares and the receipt of the net proceeds by the Company until the expected funding requirements described above have occurred.

         "Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading: Wells Fargo — Shares of the San Francisco-based lender dropped nearly 7% after the firm reported a 9% decline in net interest income. Wells Fargo recorded $11.92 billion in net interest income, a key measure of what a bank makes on lending, below the $12.12 billion expected by analysts, according to FactSet. The bank's second-quarter earnings and revenue did exceed Wall Street expectations. JPMorgan — Shares slipped 2% despite the bank posting an earnings and revenue beat for its second quarter. JPMorgan reported revenue of $50.99 billion, higher than the $49.87 billion analysts polled by LSEG had expected. The bank's per-share adjusted earnings of $4.26 also beat the forecast consensus of $4.19 in earnings per share. However, JPMorgan had a higher provision for credit losses than estimated in the current quarter, which indicates that it expects more borrowers will default on loans going forward. Citigroup — The shares dropped more than 2% even after the bank reported better-than-expected profit as investment banking activity surged. Earnings per share came in at $1.52 for the second quarter, compared to $1.39 a share expected by analysts polled by LSEG. Revenue was about as expected for the period as fixed income revenue dipped slightly. AT & T , Snowflake — AT & T shares slipped 1% after the telecommunications company revealed that a third-party platform illegally downloaded its customer data. The data, which was accessed from Snowflake, consisted primarily of call and text records between May 2022 and October 2022, according to AT & T. Snowflake shares fell 2.5%. Bank of New York Mellon — Shares popped 4.3% after the bank reported fiscal results for its second quarter that topped expectations. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.51, beating the $1.43 LSEG consensus estimate. Revenue came in at $4.6 billion, versus the $4.52 billion expected. Carvana — Shares of the used-car platform rose 4.3% on the back of BTIG's initiation at buy. BTIG said the company has an industry-leading EBITDA margin and could be able to grow both market share and profits simultaneously. Carvana shares are up more than 80% in three months.

         "Americans and Federal Reserve officials have news to celebrate: Inflation cooled significantly last month, likely giving central bankers more confidence to continue cutting interest rates. The Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, showed consumers paid 2.2% more for goods and services for the year ended in August, versus 2.5% in July. This marks another step closer toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target, as well as the lowest inflation rate seen since February 2021, when inflation clocked in at 1.9%. The annual increase was below the 2.3% rate economists projected, according to FactSet consensus estimates. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.1% in August versus the 0.2% increase in July, matching estimates. That said, “core” inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose last month to an annual pace of 2.7% from 2.6% in July. The acceleration was in line with what economists expected. However, for the month, core inflation inched up by 0.1% in August from 0.2% in July. Economists forecast a 0.2% rise in core inflation last month. President Joe Biden touted the report as a victory for the economy, with inflation coming back down to levels seen before the pandemic. “We have more work to do to lower costs and create opportunities for Americans,” Biden said in a statement Friday morning. More cuts coming? The progress seen in recent months — with inflation getting closer to 2% as well as cooling labor market conditions — pushed central bankers to cut rates by an unusually large half point earlier this month instead of the more traditional quarter-point move. Friday’s inflation report signals that another big cut that helps alleviate borrowing costs for Americans may be on its way. Still, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, who was the only one of 12 officials who voted for a smaller cut at the latest monetary policy meeting, expressed concerns that the bigger cut could “unnecessarily” stoke demand, fueling higher prices. “We have not yet achieved our inflation goal,” she said in a statement published last week. While Bowman may view Friday’s report as a welcome sign, it may not be enough to convince her to vote for a half-point cut at the Fed’s November meeting. But other officials could take it as a sign that they can continue to front-load rate cuts without having to worry as much about inflation. Meanwhile, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said in a CNBC interview last week that Producer Price Index data from August, which captures prices businesses pay at the wholesale level, pushed him to vote for the larger cut. The PPI report showed wholesale prices markedly slowed in August to a rate of 1.7% from an annual increase of 2.1% the month before. Wholesale pricing data is generally seen as a precursor to what consumers could expect to pay for goods and services in coming months. A warning sign from consumer spending, with a hint of reassurance Friday’s report comes as the mighty American consumer — largely undeterred by the highest interest rates in over 20 years — is becoming more discerning about how they spend their money. Spending last month was up an inflation-adjusted 0.1%, with spending on goods virtually unchanged from July and services spending up 0.2%. But workers are starting to see more meager wage gains: The labor market is weakening, with employers scaling back hiring new workers and the unemployment rate rising significantly over the past year. “That puts the consumer in a cautious stance,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. At the same time, the report also showed that consumers have more savings than previously thought. For the past few months, the Commerce Department has reported that consumers were saving about 3% of their disposable income. The revised data indicates they stashed away closer to 5% for those months as well as in August. However, consumers are still saving less than they had been before the pandemic, when the personal saving rate was around 7%. “The consumer looks to be on sturdier footing,” Wells Fargo economists said in a note to clients Friday. “This suggests households may have a bit more gas in the tank to support consumption.” That may not change the Fed’s calculus on rate cuts, though. Ultimately, data from upcoming job reports is likely to carry the most weight when officials make a decision at their next policy meeting, in November, on whether to cut rates and by how much, Bostjancic told CNN. One concern Fed officials may have is that steeper cuts could, as Bowman expressed, incentivize spending that consumers are currently pushing off, which is helping keep inflation in check. Bostjancic, however, feels that even if the central bank were to lower rates by another half point in November, they’d still be high enough to stop consumers from going on major spending sprees. On the other hand, lower- and middle-income consumers in particular are suffering financially such that “they need some interest rate relief,” she said.",

         "By GABRIELA SÁ PESSOA, BARBARA ORTUTAY and DAVID BILLER SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil started blocking Elon Musk’s social media platform X early Saturday, making it largely inaccessible on both the web and through mobile apps after the billionaire refused to name a legal representative to the country. The move escalates a monthslong feud between Musk and a Brazilian Supreme Court justice over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the suspension on Friday. To block X, Brazil’s telecommunications regulator, Anatel, told internet service providers to suspend users’ access to the social media platform. As of Saturday after midnight local time, major operators had begun doing so. De Moraes had warned Musk on Wednesday night that X could be blocked in Brazil if he failed to comply with his order to name a representative, and established a 24-hour deadline. The company hasn’t had a representative in the country since earlier this month. “Elon Musk showed his total disrespect for Brazilian sovereignty and, in particular, for the judiciary, setting himself up as a true supranational entity and immune to the laws of each country,” de Moraes wrote in his decision on Friday. The justice said the platform will stay suspended until it complies with his orders, and also set a daily fine of 50,000 reais ($8,900) for people or companies using VPNs to access it. In a later ruling, he backtracked on his initial decision to establish a 5-day deadline for internet service providers themselves — and not just the telecommunications regulator — to block access to X, as well as his directive for app stores to remove virtual private networks, or VPNs. Brazil is one of the biggest markets for X, which has struggled with the loss of advertisers since Musk purchased the former Twitter in 2022. Market research group Emarketer says some 40 million Brazilians, roughly one-fifth of the population, access X at least once per month. “This is a sad day for X users around the world, especially those in Brazil, who are being denied access to our platform. I wish it did not have to come to this – it breaks my heart,” X’s CEO Linda Yaccarino said Friday night, adding that Brazil is failing to uphold its constitution’s pledge to forbid censorship. X had posted on its official Global Government Affairs page late Thursday that it expected X to be shut down by de Moraes, “simply because we would not comply with his illegal orders to censor his political opponents.” “When we attempted to defend ourselves in court, Judge de Moraes threatened our Brazilian legal representative with imprisonment. Even after she resigned, he froze all of her bank accounts,” the company wrote. X has clashed with de Moraes over its reluctance to comply with orders to block users. Accounts that the platform previously has shut down on Brazilian orders include lawmakers affiliated with former President Jair Bolsonaro’s right-wing party and activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy. X’s lawyers in April sent a document to the Supreme Court in April, saying that since 2019 it had suspended or blocked 226 users. In his decision Friday, de Moraes’ cited Musk’s statements as evidence that X’s conduct “clearly intends to continue to encourage posts with extremism, hate speech and anti-democratic discourse, and to try to withdraw them from jurisdictional control.” In April, de Moraes included Musk as a target in an ongoing investigation over the dissemination of fake news and opened a separate investigation into the executive for alleged obstruction. Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist,” has repeatedly claimed the justice’s actions amount to censorship, and his argument has been echoed by Brazil’s political right. He has often insulted de Moraes on his platform, characterizing him as a dictator and tyrant. De Moraes’ defenders have said his actions aimed at X have been lawful, supported by most of the court’s full bench and have served to protect democracy at a time it is imperiled. He wrote Friday that his ruling is based on Brazilian law requiring internet services companies to have representation in the country so they can be notified when there are relevant court decisions and take requisite action — specifying the takedown of illicit content posted by users, and an anticipated churn of misinformation during October municipal elections. The looming shutdown is not unprecedented in Brazil. Lone Brazilian judges shut down Meta’s WhatsApp, the nation’s most widely used messaging app, several times in 2015 and 2016 due to the company’s refusal to comply with police requests for user data. In 2022, de Moraes threatened the messaging app Telegram with a nationwide shutdown, arguing it had repeatedly ignored Brazilian authorities’ requests to block profiles and provide information. He ordered Telegram to appoint a local representative; the company ultimately complied and stayed online. X and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in several countries — mostly authoritarian regimes such as Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan , Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest. Twitter was banned in Egypt after the Arab Spring uprisings, which some dubbed the “Twitter revolution,” but it has since been restored. A search Friday on X showed hundreds of Brazilian users inquiring about VPNs that could potentially enable them to continue using the platform by making it appear they were logging on from outside the country. It was not immediately clear how Brazilian authorities would police this practice and impose fines cited by de Moraes. “This is an unusual measure, but its main objective is to ensure that the court order to suspend the platform’s operation is, in fact, effective,” Filipe Medon, a specialist in digital law and professor at the law school of Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university in Rio de Janeiro, told The Associated Press. Mariana de Souza Alves Lima, known by her handle MariMoon, showed her 1.4 million followers on X where she intends to go, posting a screenshot of rival social network BlueSky. On Thursday evening, Starlink, Musk’s satellite internet service provider, said on X that de Moraes this week froze its finances, preventing it from doing any transactions in the country where it has more than 250,000 customers. “This order is based on an unfounded determination that Starlink should be responsible for the fines levied—unconstitutionally—against X. It was issued in secret and without affording Starlink any of the due process of law guaranteed by the Constitution of Brazil. We intend to address the matter legally,” Starlink said in its statement. The law firm representing Starlink told the AP that the company appealed, but wouldn’t make further comment. Musk replied to people sharing the reports of the freeze, adding insults directed at de Moraes. “This guy @Alexandre is an outright criminal of the worst kind, masquerading as a judge,” he wrote. Musk later posted on X that SpaceX, which runs Starlink, will provide free internet service in Brazil “until the matter is resolved” since “we cannot receive payment, but don’t want to cut anyone off.” In his decision, de Moraes said he ordered the freezing of Starlink’s assets, as X didn’t have enough money in its accounts to cover mounting fines, and reasoning that the two companies are part of the same economic group. While ordering X’s suspension followed warnings and fines and so was appropriate, taking action against Starlink seems “highly questionable,” said Luca Belli, coordinator of the Getulio Vargas Foundation’s Technology and Society Center. “Yes, of course, they have the same owner, Elon Musk, but it is discretionary to consider Starlink as part of the same economic group as Twitter (X). They have no connection, they have no integration,” Belli said. ___ Ortutay reported from San Francisco and Biller from Rio. AP writer Mauricio Savarese contributed from Sao Paulo.
